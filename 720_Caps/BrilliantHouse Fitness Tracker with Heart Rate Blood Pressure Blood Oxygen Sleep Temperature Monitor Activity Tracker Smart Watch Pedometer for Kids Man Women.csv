very happy with this tracker!,5.0,got my wife a smart watch worth 5 times more than this one she was happy with it and encouraged me to get one as well i noticed this one takes the temperature beside the heart rate blood pressure and oxygen saturation and all the other pretty standard functions including step counting and sleep tracking so went for it had a question early on contacted the seller super responsive heard back within a day and it was a real person who actually resolved my question instead of an automated reply so kudos to customer service i charged the watch once fully and waited to write a review until it ran out impressive 3 weeks and half that s with daily wearing and at least once a day checking my temperature heart rate blood pressure and oxygen concentration i know smart watches are not medical devices no expectation of medical degree accuracy and i don t have any chronic conditions to challenge the tracker from my first month daily experience very rarely i would get a crazy value it has only happened with heart rate as if i m tachycardic when i m not i measure it again i get a normal number i believe the temp is probably the most useful feature for me in case i feel warm and think i have a fever want to comment on the 1 button easy operation it s not really a button but like a small rectangular area below the screen which has a really good resolution my son has a toy smart watch with a bunch of games but low resolution so a high resolution screen is good short press the rectangle the watch takes you from one screen function to another it automatically measures my heart rate when i leave the screen on that function for longer than a second or two and for screens with additional functions like the screen that says more you long press on the rectangle to access the additional function also long press to back out or exit unlike my son s toy watch this one can be turned off completely the band feels soft and fine crafted definitively not cheap plastic or rubber my wife s watch uses a magnet charger on the back i was apprehensive about this one s plug in charging that it might become loose after a number of charges but judging by the battery s longevity and the quality bands don t think i need to worry about it the other thing i have liked it s the app pretty clean and also straightforward i can turn on and off functions on the app when i synch the watch to phone i like to keep it minimalistic there is a function i haven t seen on other smart watches which is named women s health once you input some data it suppose to track where you are in your cycle i m a guy cannot tell what it does as connection and reconnection between watch and phone for me it has been reliable of course i do need to have the bluetooth on the phone the app also requires me to have the location on when the location is off the app won t connect with the watch otherwise the watch seems to function entirely on its own once i set it up with the app out of the box i m still impressed by how many things this high tech bracelet app pair can do even though for my daily use i got all the functions i m interested on the watch time date notification call text vital signs and more step counting reminders calories burn in summary great tracker bracelet smart watch with awesome battery power well made informative app useful function the best customer service and stuff i haven t seen in other and older models such as temp and women s health highly recommended i have like it so much that i have bought screen protectors for it one more thing i fish so i has also survived good couple of raining days no problem ,positive
Works well. Happy about it.,1.0,I am using the tracker for a few days now The package was small slim and easy to handle I bought a few cheap trackers over the years and the weight of this one gave me a sense of quality Just like a Samsung phone has a certain weight compared to an Obamaphone The overall blackness of the band is very satisfying all around The adjustable bracelet is very generous and you could probably fit a medium dog s neck It s a guess I don t have dogs I have small wrists and there are 4 or 5 holes left The app or weirdly the apps are 2? There is RunMeFit and RunMiFit from the same company Now the ME one is crap forget about it while the MI one mostly works just fine I actually like it a lot The home screen has big fat rectangles with the vital and its graph Clean customizable simple The device paired in a couple of clicks and you can customize the clock face You can snap a picture or take it from the gallery and put it as the background and there are a bunch of templates for the clock I picked the simple big 2 lines clock white on black I didn t try the sport modes because they usually work fine across the board There are some cons which hopefully will be addressed at some point There is no dark theme the app is bright white and it burns my eyes The Google Fit integration is there but it doesn t seem to work after 3 days there is no trace of any data whatsoever I cleared data reinstalled the app and went through the setup all over again nothing I got a smart scale too a couple of weeks ago and that one works flawlessly turned on paired clicked on my G account and it started pumping data into Google Fit so it s not me This is almost a disservice I will try to contact them to point this out The tracker itself is fairly comfortable I slept a couple of nights with it with tight grip and it didn t bother me at all But take it with a grain of salt nothing really bothers me at night because of the herbs you know As I mentioned before the finish is quite appealing it doesn t look bulky just a nice accessory on my manly arm The screen IS NOT OLED It s a good screen clear and colorful but you can see that the whole rectangle with black background is lit and it s unusable under California s majestic sunshine The readings are consistent I care more about that than anything else My goal is to improve so even if the gadget is a bit off my goal is to have the numbers move in the right direction Also a spike in temperature means fever no matter what the actual number is so the tracker will give me useful health data anyway For 20 the measurements seem about right The single button operation is a nightmare no matter what and I never use it regularly It s touchy and just like all the others will trip itself here and there I imagine it will go nuts like all the others in the shower I learned to charge them while showering that s a good tip for you I hate touch buttons with all my heart I have expensive earbuds with touch and cheap AF clicky earbuds the regular buttons are so much better and flawless Why do they do that? It s 100 reliable while the touch is horrible and I guess more expensive A fine lil to none clicky button would be beautiful it gives you feedback it better interacts with your senses and it doesn t misfire Some time ago I was wandering with the herbs you know having a good time and nature touched me a soft leaf from a tree surrounded by rays of light came out of the breeze to kiss me and gently caressed my ear and the freaking music stopped and it ruined everything and Alexa popped up and she picks up on my ramblings about it and she starts rambling about nonsense she googled I hate touch buttons The lift to wake is understandably unreliable It will not work when needed here and there it will lit up and bother you while finding a comfortable position to sleep No I bought it and THEN they put it on sale It s so tempting to send this one back and buy it cheaper muahaha But how about you developer claim that five dollars have a beer on me and fix the G Fit problem? CheersOverall I am happy about it and most of the cons are about things to be improved more than missing Of all the trackers I had this is the most complete customizable and easy to use It s a 4 5 stars tracker but while Google Fit integration doesn t work it s 1 star ,positive
