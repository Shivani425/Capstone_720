"Good, but could be better",4.0,You ll probably think that I m being overly critical but I hope that the manufacturer sees this and fixes them as it s more a firmware app issue Good: It s comfortable enough that if you place it well so it doesn t interfere with your hand movements like typing you basically forget it s there as least for my size of hand if you have larger finger I suspect you ll want to cut the ring at its thin point so it s not squeezing too much The probe seems to hold up okay to getting wet as if you forget it s there you ll end up washing your hands with it still on The probe is small enough that I m able to put my preferred size of nitrile gloves over it Could be better: There s wasted space on the top line of the wrist display I ve only ever seen a bluetooth symbol there I would love to have larger numbers or a PI display so you can position it without needing to use the app If it s a power drain maybe only calculate it when on the second display screen with the battery indicator time bluetooth ID You can t get a real time graph of your usage This is odd because the same app does graph in real time for the Wellue fingertop pulseox For this device however you have to wait until it decides to download however many hours of data it s logged and then can view the graph I would love to be able to look down at my phone and see what the recent trend is especially right after it alarms did my pulse spike up or slowly creep up? And I should mention I ve only been wearing it for about 40hrs so it s possible that there are other issues that will show up but so far it seems to be a solid product that I d recommend Update:So after wearing it for almost two weeks straight which I know is not what it s designed for some more notes: You can get a near realtime graph by unplugging the sensor and clicking the button to cancel the 10 secnd timer Plug it back in and it ll start a new session allowing you to download the data collected in the last log It s not ideal but it s better than waiting for it to hit 10 hours and end the session on its own The sensor uses the same plug as for charging it This is good don t have an open port if you splash water on it but means that I misplaced the sensor once when charging it I ve since gotten in the habit of putting the finger loop on the wrist band to secure it while charging Medical gloves go over it fine but gauntlet length gardening gloves might be a problem I think as it covered the wrist device that it held down the button and powered it off I m not sure how accurate the numbers are I wore it while doing a stress test at a cardiologist and they said my pulse hit 155 but this device showed 130 and this worries me as I had a time two days earlier when the device maxed out at 150 It s also generally 2 lower for O2 sat than the fingertip sensor which is within tolerance for non medical grade sensors usually each is accurate to 1 2 so 2 4 when comparing two so the trends going up down steady is better to look at than absolute numbers If you re wearing it 24x7 pick a time of the day to make sure you dump your data or you risk it rolling over enough times that you ll get a gap in your logs Especially if you accidentally power it off and it generates an extra log You can downlink the logs while it s charging You can move the sensor even to a number finger without it generating another log if you re quick about it within 10 seconds This is useful if you start to feel a bit sweaty under the band If you re doing something that vibrates mowing the lawn other power tools make sure to turn the vibrations all the way up or turn on the phone app so you don t miss the alarms If you hold the button on the device down for a few seconds I think it does a factory reset deleting all of your settings and whatever s been logged this is a really bad design as you might roll onto it in the night and reset the whole thing ,positive
Can't get it to connect to PC program.,4.0,Have had zero luck getting it to connect to the O2 Insight Pro program on my computer Connected both via bluetooth and USB together and individually It never connects to the program Someone online suggested exporting the files as csv data which I did but there s no way to import it into the program and view it there Yes I know I can bring it into Excel but then it s just raw data without context Extremely frustrating as I like it otherwise Works very well to track my O2 drops overnight Easy to transfer data to the app on my phone Just turn on the app and allow it to connect via bluetooth and boom the data is there just make sure you ve ended the session by either unplugging the sensor or turning the unit off and on first then transfer will be automatic Disappointed because I really had wished to see the data on the computer in a larger format than I can see on my phone ,positive
App data is most detailed,4.0,Purchased for night time measurements Read other reviews with compliants connecting device to app Based on other reviews I have not created an online account Followed provided instructions to connect CheckmeO2 to my Android phone using the ViHealth app Each morning I disconnect the sensor from the wrist device wait the 10 seconds for the session to end then open the ViHealth app for the data to download If the CheckmeO2 is not automatically connected I just hit the Connect button in the app The device connecting to the PC software for reports that can be emailed that is inconsistent for me Why a proprietary USB connection was chosen seems like a poor choice to me as trying a different cable is not something readily available The app data is a better visualization than the PC software reports The app data can expand and contract its timeline for zooming in out ,positive
software used to connect to Win10 PC stopped working after first connection,3.0,UPDATE:Odd how the O2 Insight Pro software works no telling when it will download data files or what the frequency is That said I have been able to download twice more now and have not missed any logs so far If I remember correctly the O2 Pulse Oximeter only keeps 4 files of data which forces downloads frequently In my case I plan to use this data against what my Fitbit Charge 5 with the Premium Service plan is stating as well as a Zio XT patch ordered by my doctor which I wore for the past 2 weeks I will be sharing all this information with my doctor also My hope is that they all provide similar results that validate how good etc these health monitors are Other thoughts:The Wellue Os Pulse Oximeter is made in China by Shenzhen Viatom Technology Co Given this is collecting health data I m concerned about exfiltration of this information and to whom and what purpose it could be used for There is no claim I ve found of user privacy stating health data is safe Perhaps I m being paranoid and suggest if you use this device and the associated software to put in bogus user data i e name approx age approx weight etc Buyer beware Initial Post:There is software that connects the device to my iPhone Vihealth and there s the software that connects the device to the PC for downloading data and storing as csv or pdf files This software is called O2 Insight Pro V1 8 0 This part no longer works I ve attached a screenshot of the error message see attached The 2 errors I see are: Can not connect to device bottom left and No device connected bottom right I have the device connected via the USB cable that came with the product I have verified in USB devices it shows up with a green status i e all good to go The first time I connected the device the software worked perfectly and downloaded all 4 data files Since then I ve received the same error 10 times now Here s what I tried to resolve the issue:1 uninstalled reinstalled software Nope notta 2 installed software on completely different computer and tried to download no go 3 Removed any folder structure left by the uninstall then reinstalled again no go 4 Tried other USB ports no go My goal here is to find a reliable tool for continuously tracking my heart rate and blood oxygen levels and providing the data results to my doctor for analysis or at least for comparison against other health trackers I currently have the FitBit Charge 5 as well as an Apple Watch 5 The Checkme OS Max Smart Wrist Pulse Oximeter looked like the perfect tool to use here and for a reasonable cost also But without the data download capability this has become impossible I ve opened a ticket with Wellue support Stay tuned for updates ,positive
