Easy set up.,4.0,Easy to set up Agents were very easy to work with Hopefully will never need to use ,positive
Hopeful it works in an emergency,3.0,After reading the reviews I was hesitant but purchased anyways The first test run the device was answered promptly After a week we tested the device again Over 4 min before a representative came across I m sorry In the event of an emergency 4 min is not ok It took 3 days for someone to call back and resolve the issue We have tested the device again and the timing was better Hopefully this will not be an issue from now on ,neutral
Excellent Product - Never Felt More Secure,5.0,In June I suffered an ischemic stroke I spent a week in the hospital and came home with a lot of fear Just one week prior my husband was across the country on business and my kids were with their father I had been by myself Had it happened when I was alone I m not sure what would have happened So I feared the next time if there was a next time What if he was at work and the kids not here?With this product I don t have to worry anymore When my stroke happened I was really too out of it to look for my phone and make a call but I could have pressed a button That is what makes this so perfect It is on me so it really is as easy as a button press Not only will they call 911 but then my husband as well And it s affordable too And you can have it in a lanyard around your neck or on a belt clip for times you may not want it to show It s also water resistant so I can have it with you by the shower It was easy to set up and the staff I spoke to on the phone was so friendly This has given me such a sense of security If you have elderly parents or a medical condition yourself I highly recommend this ,positive
"Difficult setup, never got it right in their system, SO HARD TO CANCEL!!",1.0,I am so disappointed The set up for this device was pretty painful I followed all instructions I did what was instructed and had to CALL THEM because it wasn t working Well I guess it was working on their end and they had dispatched an ambulance to my dad s house : After that got worked out the device never properly registered to the account So they were drafting almost 40 a month out for no equipment Fantastic My dad didn t use it He has it unplugged on his bar so why pay 40 a month for that? Especially when it DOES NOT bring up your care circle or let you talk to a rep They automatically dispatch an ambulance So I tried to cancel I sent THREE emails I finally got a call from someone who wanted to know WHY I wanted to cancel I told her cancel it; I m getting annoyed She says they have to send me a form in email to print sign and return before they can cancel Really?Sure enough it s a cease and desist form lol Seriously? Sending that back in now with a digital signature so who knows if it ll go through THEN they say it can still take up to 30 days before cancellation is complete after receiving the cease and desist I have told them on ALL correspondence and via the phone call if they charge my card once more it ll be disputed as unauthorized because I AM CANCELLING What a nightmare Life Alert costs more but I m sure they re easier to deal with than these people which is why they re 1 Don t cheap out with these people It s not worth it ,positive
Itâ€™s a great product and could save my life.,5.0,At 89 years old and after several falls I was convinced that I needed a protective device so I checked with the on the go cust service and the gentleman on the line walked me through the unit and I made a trial call that went through and I could talk to the contact We spent three days in New Hampshire we re from connecticut and I called the unit and they answered right away I don t know the specs but it was explained that it follows wi fi unlimited It seems to be a great product I m very happy with it ,positive
Paid for it's self,5.0,Unit was easy to setup and trial run with customer service I was at work the operator called and said mom fell and they had dispatched the ambulance Once I got to her house she had slipped off the couch hit her head on floor couldn t move and there was blood So in my mind for the cost of the unit it just paid for itself Battery life is good for about 28 30 days so far I m pleased with it ,positive
Great service,5.0,This is just want I wanted for peace of mind The people who answer are very polite and professional When I called as part of the set up process they also gave me a lot of good information that really helped The best is that Amazon gives a year free service which normally costs almost 37 month That makes this the best offer you ll find ,positive
Avoid this company,1.0,I have zero confidence in Medical Guardian Their device and GPS location finding capabilities did not work and their customer service systems and processes have issues Based on my experience the company is bordering on fraudulent I purchased the GPS based Medical Guardian device in 10 19 on Amazon for a family member The device uses the Verizon network for communications Most of Medical Guardian s previous devices apparently use AT Ts network per their tech support team The first device would not complete setup after many troubleshooting calls to Medical Guardian I am an electrical engineer and software developer and could tell their tech support was struggling to get services working as advertised A replacement device from Amazon completed setup but the GPS locating details never seemed to work Test calls to their call center worked but they could sometimes not understand my elderly family member I asked for GPS tracking of my family member through their website and they indicated they would eventually have that Eventually my elderly family member was told that the device would only work through Wifi as Medical Guardian could not get the Verizon GPS locating feature working This is not what we needed Most of the customer service and tech support and call center interactions have been OK but there has been very poor follow through especially when it comes to canceling the service Avoid this company ,positive
