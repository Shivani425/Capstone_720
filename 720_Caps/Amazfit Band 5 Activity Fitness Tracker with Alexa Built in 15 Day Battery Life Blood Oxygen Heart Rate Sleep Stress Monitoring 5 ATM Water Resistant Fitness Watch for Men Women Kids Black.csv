This Band's Usefulness Grows on You,5.0,UPDATED 12 31 2020 [This a a real review]Set up is easy as you download the Zepp app and pair the watch to your bluetooth then register to sign in The little band is a bit hard to fasten on your wrist at first as you get used to it and I have had it come off in bed and once just in everyday use possibly because it wasn t fully secured but more likely due to catching the closure button on something The read outs are easy to use although the instructions and explanations of functions are somewhat vague The measurements to input some manual things like blood pressure body temperature etc are only in UK measurements so you have to convert the numbers Hopefully they will change this for imperial measurements too In your profile the standard measurements can be set to imperial or UK so there is no confusion seeing your readouts on your band or in the app The band itself provides the ability to change around the menus so those you re most interested in can be scrolled to up or down left or right quicker You can rotate your wrist toward you to activate one of the chosen 45 provided watch faces the automatic watch face reveal can be scheduled to turn off when you re sleeping or you can just tap the lower part of the face and the length of time for viewing can be changed too Then you can scroll the menu so that side to side brings up Alexa Notifications in one directions and Weather Heart rate in the other as they repeat in a circle Pulling the screen down reveals More Workout Weather Events Breathing Stress Notifications SpO2 Heart Rate PAI Status before returning back the the watch face MORE gives you options: DND Alarm Camera Music Stopwatch Timer Find Device Silent World Clock Band Display Settings When you use the app to download one of the 45 watch faces band display at least five remain as a choice in the Band Display section for quick change Settings allows further adjustments to the watch face use and ability to reboot WORKOUT: Outdoor Running Treadmill Cycling Indoor Cycling Walking Elliptical Rowing Machine Yoga Jump Rope Pool Swimming FreestyleWEATHER gives you current local conditions and forecast for the next six days Temperature Humidity Level QualityEVENTS are reminders of upcoming things you input by speaking into the watch BREATHING is an exercise to calm and relax you STRESS measures your level between 0 and 100 based on heart and pulse ox and other factors SPO2 also known as oxygen saturation is a measure of the amount of oxygen carrying hemoglobin in the blood relative to the amount of hemoglobin not carrying oxygen The body needs a certain level of oxygen in the blood or it will not function as efficiently In fact very low levels of SpO2 can result in very serious symptoms You can quickly test here to obtain your SpO2 HEART RATE measures the beats per minute BPM and can be set to check this periodically or manually here PAI is the physical activity intelligence that takes data to provide a number up to 100 showing your activity level and this number climbs as days pass and it automatically computes the number You can quickly do a manual test here too following the on screen directions STATUS shows your steps calories used distance walked idle alerts if so set and previous days step counts ALEXA is a nice addition and works well with responses in text format It is not necessary to say the name Alexa just scroll to menu and input your command or question I often use my Band 5 to turn on off or command smart lights plugs and smart light strips I can walk in a room and command a light or change the temperature on the Ecobee Thermostat if so desired Very quick responses to questions and computations make this a very nice feature NOTIFICATION work very well and promptly show on the watch face to be easily read and can be scrolled if a long message is received BATTERY LIFE so far seems to be on average around two week at least before a 2 hour charge is necessary using the round magnetically attached plug and short cord I charged mine after 12 days at 17 remaining charge so it would have gone a full two weeks before going dead CONCLUSION There is a lot to explore and I have continued too use a Fitbit Versa for steps and distance as well as another app MapMyRun to plot the GPS path and distance I have not gotten the Amazfit Band 5 to accurately give my distance and show a GPS plotted route like the MapMyRun app provides However the step count is more accurate It may well be that the Versa and MapMyRun app are interfering with the GPS so that Band 5 cannot calculate this properly I will experiment in time and work with developers to see if a solution can be found but it s not a big problem for me MapMyRun s browser data and history with routes is quite satisfactory and I have found history is available when you use the icon in the top right of the Zepp app and see under Exercise Data the Exercise Record where period of time can be selected and individual dates show full data again the routes shown and distance steps are wrong so far and still experimenting with this error The Versa serves as a watch and notifications I can easily read Band 5 does not provide the ability to switch functions while using the Workout function but it does show notifications So you cannot use the Band 5 for anything else during work outs if I am not mistaken Note that outside in the sunlight it is very hard to read the screen however unless you turn the brightness up under setting to maximum from the default applied to conserve battery Overall I am very pleased with all the data including the SLEEP DATA it provides for helping the wearer to better health A beta Breathing tracking function can be set to check for problems while you sleep and it scored me 99 out of 100 As you turn on things like this it does warn of extra battery use It could be and probably will be tweaked so the wearer can more customize it to the wearer s own needs and life For the price it is great and now there is an inexpensive compatible replacement band assortment in 15 colors for easy change to coordinate with your daily wardrobe As I wear and use the Band 5 I may add more to this review UPDATE AFTER DST: Strangely the sleep record is not recording on the date it should and runs a day behind Reporting errors or suggested improvements seems to go unnoticed as the step count is still showing the miles lower than actual e g 3 miles is shown as approximately 2 5 even though the steps are correct so the stride distance is wrong and possibly due to the GPS not working correctly with my Moto G6 Plus watch No fix so I depend on my cell s app MayMyRun to accurately record this for me ,positive
DIFFERENCES: BAND 5 vs 7 MONITORING & MORE,4.0,Screenshots: the Bands LED PD arrays; Walking in Zepp app of a daily 1 mile crisscross walk in my backyard satellite view can be chosen too; needs the phone s Bluetooth and cell or Wi Fi connections plus enabled location service s I posted a Band 5 review and Amazon won t allow one separate to it for the Band 7 So my Band 5 review follows these Band 5 vs Band 7 details I used the Band 5 all of December 2022 and then the Band 7 to date I no longer have the 5 so I rely on my recollections The physical differences for the two bands is self evident The Zepp app is really really good IMHO For the fitness health feature sets and user interface the Amazfit web site has plenty of info The FAQs and Support pages are good but you need to really scrape around and dig for the it There are gobs of online videos for these two bands The Band 5 user PDF is awful Presented here are the core components and workings of the two bands stuff a blend of Amazfit and searched for online info and my observations the later being to the best of my ability Mobile device integration sharing etc in watch and in Zepp Workout apps and Alexa are not discussed with the exception of the screenshot and this:I have observed when using the Walking app in the Band or the Zepp app BPM is real time One might expect the same for the other apps While the real time data is recorded in Zepp s Homepage Workout History X Y chart the Homepage Heart Rate chart will be for the user selected 1 5 10 or 30 minute intervals BPM SpO2Band 5: An array of 2 LEDs and 1 PD photo detector Band 7: The same redesigned Motion movementBand 5: 3 axis gyroscopic sensorBand 7: Geomagnetic sensorBand 5 7: 3 axis acceleration sensor Data engine algorithmsBand 5: BioTracker 2Band 7: BioTracker 3 Operating systemBand 5 7: Zepp OS Band 5 monitoring Same as Band 7 but no BPM Activity Detection Feature I think I can t recall if the Workout Walking app BPM was real time Band 7 monitoring BPM Stress SpO2: 24 hour BPM will update at user selected frequencies when awake: 1 5 10 or 30 minutes If set at the higher frequencies the Activity Detection Feature sets at 1 minute for the duration of the activity On the spot manual updates can be taken at any time Band display of real time BPM display is not available but real time is confirmed by me for the Workout Walking app Stress and SpO2 updates are 5 minutes only During sleep BPM updates every minute Stress and SpO4 update every 5 minutes While awake on the spot manual updates can be taken; SpO2 requires up to 30 seconds Stress needs all of 45 seconds while keeping the arm at rest motionless While awake auto updates will be taken if the arm is at rest motionless for five or more minutes and remains so for the 20 and 45 seconds needed Other The 5 is sleek the 7 is not Band 5 watch faces are far more available given its greater market place exposure Band 7 may catch up in time Available Band 7 watch faces seriously lack component customization Band 7 replacement and designer bands have to catch up to the overwhelming choices available for the Band 5 The timeline that defines sleep is fixed at midnight to 8 AM Sleep health data is a dubious universally for all bands and watches across all price points The breathing health algorithm is beta as of this writing but looks promising And The reflectance driven BPM and Sp02 spot check values match that of my FDA Class II transmittance EMAY EMO 80 pulse oximeter Given the near instant transmittance sensors today s reflectance sensors other than being a bit slow have come a long way for spot checks I wore my Medline WR30M pedometer with each band for a week each and the distance step count and BPM data matched the Bands data pretty much spot on With 24 7 wear and all monitoring features enabled and daily half hour use of the Walking in watch app my Band 7 battery alerts at the 20 level after 8 9 days Bluetooth not used but for 1 2 day Zepp syncs Using fast Nokia or RAVPower chargers it takes 25 minutes to reach 50 Another 15 to 75 and another 30 to 99 where it takes another 20 minutes to get to 100 Regardless of the progress values reported it s been a consistent 90 minutes from 20 to 100 ,positive
