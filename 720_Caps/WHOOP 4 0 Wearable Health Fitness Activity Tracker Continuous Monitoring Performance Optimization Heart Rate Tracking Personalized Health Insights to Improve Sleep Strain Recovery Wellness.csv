The Best Fitness Tracker!,5.0,I love this tracker and it s charge on the go feature I can wear it 24 7 and it s super sleek on my wrist I ve been working on getting more consistent sleep the whoop tracks how much time I spend in each sleep stage and has a nifty feature that coaches you on when to go to bed based off of how much sleep your body needs I use the health monitor every morning to check my heart rate variability and resting heart rate I can also easily email my cardiologist a history of these metrics straight from the app how neat It s been interesting to see what activities increase my strain the most between hiking yard work and walking my husky I also like the stress monitor I use the breathing exercise after having a presentation at work The whoop seems to be getting smarter as I use it more how cool ,positive
Fitness and health coaching- all in one tracking device.,5.0,This literally took me a few minutes to set up and is surprisingly comfortable I am not a watch or bracelet wearing type of person I really wanted to find a tracker that could help me understand my sleep patterns and overall daily health and this definitely lives up to my expectations Looking to add a few of the colored bands which apparently can swap out with the tracker The black band is nice but mixing it up for different occasions would be dun so I can wear it as much as possible ,positive
Helped me get better quality sleep,5.0,I usually don t leave reviews But Whoop has transformed my sleep routine in a big way I m loving how it tracks my sleep quality duration and stages and the coaching in the app has helped me nail down the perfect bedtime for optimal rest and recovery Since I started using Whoop my sleep has improved significantly and it s made a noticeable impact on my overall health and performance Highly recommend it ,positive
Whoop There It Is!,5.0,Already loving my Whoop The journaling feature is very helpful in tracking my behaviors in terms of how much caffeine I m drinking how stressed I am and tracking which vitamins I am taking The onboarding content that pops up in the App has been super helpful to learn the features of the Whoop My favorite so far is how much sleep I am getting versus how much sleep I need Excited to keep using the Whoop This is a great investment so far in my health ,positive
Literally Doesnâ€™t Work,1.0,I purchased the Whoop 4 0 after a friend introduced me to it Looked and sounded great Hopefully I just have a faulty one and no one else has experienced this specifically as it s a health related product not a pleasurable purchase just seems to make the fact it s completely dead even more so After fully charging three times it s won t connect with my Bluetooth no light indicator when tapped as instructed literally lifeless Sending back Such a shame as the concept of the product was a major interest to me ,positive
Great product! Everything as described by WHOOP!,5.0,I ve been using an Apple Watch up to this point and my wife uses a WHOOP We ve compared and contrasted the data and information we have access to the interface of that information and the phone app I finally am making the switch over to Whoop My Apple Watch still has other valuable functionality that I find useful but the health component isn t comparable to the WHOOP ,positive
Love my Whoop!,5.0,Really love that Whoop doesn t have a screen but still provides an immense plethora of data and information Extremely accurate tracking in such a compact and wearable device Battery life if fantastic as well ,positive
I love this thing!,5.0,Super comfortable fitness tracker works great Couldn t be happier with this ,positive
