Good deal,4.0,I wanted to wear this watch a couple weeks before reviewing Overall it seems pretty good After shopping around I chose this one since it could monitor body temperature I ve never had a smart watch before so thought I d try something on the cheaper side first First of all I have no idea how accurate it is since I don t have anything to compare it to So far it s reading have been reasonable with a little oddness here and there Generally I think the sleep tracking pretty accurate it at least is pretty good about knowing when I fall asleep and when I wake up As for it recording deep sleep I have no idea if it s true or not Only one night in the last two weeks was it super off where I had it on the charger for a bit and it recorded that as light sleep for some reason lol I ve only tried the walking workout mode since that s mainly what I do for exercise I don t think it has GPS so it counts steps based on movement rather than distance which I like since sometimes I need to exercise in the living room I found that I must change it to workout mode for it to monitor my heartrate correctly My body temperature consistently reads at around 97 degrees F about a degree lower than expected so I assume it may be about 1 degree off I think the app is fine It does ask for permissions but the amount of access it wants seems reasonable to me For example there is an option to take a photo of yourself for your profile and it only asks for camera access if you choose to do that Each time you open the app it takes a moment for the watch to sync I only experienced a connection issue once and lost my step data for the day but the app keeps track of your previous daily data which wasn t affected I like seeing the data over time and the graphs it provides There is an option in the app to check menstrual cycle too which I found useful There aren t a lot of watch faces to pick from but I didn t really care about that too much I just use the default since it displays the data in an organized digestible way I think most difficult thing to do was find the option to turn on the flashlight lol I don t foresee myself using that feature much I haven t used it to control my music or anything The charge easily lasts for a week All in all I like this watch and it serves its purpose I would be curious to test how accurate it really is But I think it is definitely worth the price and I don t think I need to buy a more expensive one ,positive
"Deecent enough watch, but a few caveats",4.0,Watch is simple enough to use and set up The battery lasts at least five days You can set it up without the app but the app does make it easier However the app currently listed in the Google Play store is woefully outdated and won t run on Android 7 I had to hunt down an updated version in order to get it to load on my tablet Second warning the charging cable is cheap Had two cables on two watches fail pins retracted into body of plug Third issue is that the watch sometimes locks up but holding the button in for 10 seconds usually works Keep these in mind when purchasing the watch Otherwise it s a good buy for the price ,negative
Best features in a fitness watch I have found.,5.0,I love this watch I recently had heart abnormalities and didn t know it Now all I have to do is look at my watch or better yet the phone app to see my blood pressure heart rate blood oxygen and skin temperature as well as my steps for the day and my sleep time The app is a little clunky I had to input my height and weight in metric or I could not go any further in the app Once the app has your info you can go to me and reset Units to Imperial I tried to link the app to Google Fit but FitCloudPro would not transfer my vitals to Google Fit so I uninstalled Google Fit I am especially impressed with the accuracy of the vitals as I compared them while in my Drs office I highly recommend this watch especially after the drop in price I ordered another one as a gift I found a watch band that has two lengths of the long side band included I hope it will solve my watchband problem,positive
Initial Impression -- 1st day,3.0,OK first day impression:1 The app FitCloudPro seems disappointing Seems to want a tremendous mass of permissions which have zero to do with the functions it provides You are pretty much giving them total and absolute permission to collect every possible bit of data from you your phone your watch including location control over e mails sent and received rerouting e mails sent and received permission to make surreptitious calls refusal to turn off the phone I don t think you re giving up your first born child in there but I would not place money on it I see ZERO justification for this Did not install for that reason Open to suggestions of alternatives that can access the phone and keep track of settings if there is any way to do this 2 The phone itself Can t speak to the accuracy of the measurements yet but it seems to not bother to KEEP any of them other than the walking numbers WTF?3 There s no way to set up regular checks and since it does not KEEP anything what use would THAT be? for example if you want to get hourly BP and Blood Oxy metrics why not?There s a LOT of potential here but the built in software seems to just suck the sweat off donkey glands And I don t see why The functions mentioned above are OBVIOUS Really really OBVIOUS I d give it three and a half stars if that was an option If the software app associated wasn t such an absurdly ridiculous permissions goniff I d give it four If it recorded anything for future use retrieval I d give it four and a half to five ,positive
