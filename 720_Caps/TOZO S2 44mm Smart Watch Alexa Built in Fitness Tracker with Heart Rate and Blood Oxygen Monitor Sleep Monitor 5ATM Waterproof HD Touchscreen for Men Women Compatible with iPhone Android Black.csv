Great value but has issues; customer service has been awesome so I want the product to be the same!,5.0,Edit 12 03 22 Original review is below but i wanted to update on the company sending me a new watch I received the new one watch 11 03 22 I wanted to wait to see how it responded or if it would be a lemon like the first one Just over a month using the watch and I have no complaints This watch is very reasonable on price and it works great for my needs Obviously the normal it is a watch It tracks your steps fairly well and measures heartbeat stress and sleep You are also able to sync it with your phone and receive messages to the watch I bought a different watch band for it and a screen cover to make the watch last longer I took off the wrist twist gesture because I do not need it to turn on at random times while I m working for no reason This helps save the battery and I can easily go a week without charging it With the wrist gesture on it might need a charge every 3 5 days depending on how often it turns on and off In closing I would definitely buy this again and it exceeds my needs for what I wanted Grade A for overall The initial issues made it a minus but their company made good on sending me a replacement and I like the watch and brand Original review:After reviewing the rating for this watch I figured I would give it a try I had bought Tozo earbuds for myself and family in the past and never had any issues So looking for a smart watch I would give this a try and support the company Out of the box it looks great and it sync s up with your phone very easily The Tozo app I think is user friendly and gives you all the necessary information from the app to your wrist and then back quickly Here s the problem I had the watch for about 15 days and one morning I woke up and put in on my wrist and the display screen was failing I attached pictures showing what it was doing It appears that something is not connected correctly inside the watch or the screen lcd portion has failed I immediately contacted customer service via email thru the App They responded within one business day After providing the purchase history Sophia from Tozo could be just the they list for all service emails was sending me a new watch free of charge and to keep the damaged watch to avoid any further hassle That was amazing and awesome customer service Granted I had to send multiple screenshots of where I bought it when I bought it and had to give a review hence this long experience But to continue reviewing the watch I will give more information The Battery After a fully charged watch it could last 5 8days If you have the wrist motion turned on the watch wakes up more often and in turn waste more battery life 2 3 days I have since turned it off and lowered the display brightness to conserve battery The connectivity of the watch works great It receives emails text msg phone calls You can change the main screen to a variety of different displays It has an Alexa feature built in but I have not used yet The timer appeared to work great along with the alarm flashlight and stop watch I am still unsure of the accuracy of the measurements for the heart beat and stress levels It appears to be an average but I believe it gives a decent reading The step counter is what I use the most and I feel it is fairly accurate I have not received the replacement watch yet Says it will take several weeks Once I receive the newer watch I am hoping the screen will last alot longer then the first watch Overall I currently will give this watch a C It works very well but having the screen take a crap so quickly I m hesitant the newer one will be faulty also After I receive the replacement and I use the watch for a longer period of time if the watch holds up then a newer update review will be given and a higher rating will be issued Until then I ll be using a watch that has failed too quickly ,positive
Good entry level smart watch.,4.0,Let s start with the good It does track heart rate sleep patterns O2 levels and steps The battery life is remarkably good for price point Watch strap installation is simple and bands are easily replaced There is an app required to log all your bios The app is fairly easy to use and compliments the watch well There are a variety of watch faces available in the watch s app so you can customize what you first see when your watch lights up As for the water resistance I don t live near any oceans to go SCUBA diving down to 5 atmospheres as the watch claims But washing the dishes doesn t affect it in the slightest I do like the fact that the functionality is simple It s either swipe down to view notifications left or right to view the different bios and a quick press on the side button to bring up all the options the different bio sensors settings and general widgets the phone offers The downsides the watch strap strikes me as easily tear able I work in a machine shop and suspect in the near future the strap will end up getting cut off by a metal chip The screen face has a 4 5mm dead space all around the rim of the watch which is useless for viewing and just takes up more wrist space The side button is overly large and if you bend your wrist back far enough in my case sleeping or crossing my arms across my chest I trigger the button draining battery life Alexa is only operable if you go to the Alexa widget on the phone you can t activate Alexa by simply saying Hey Alexa There is also no voice to text replies to text messages You ll have to open your phone to reply Overall for the price point if all you need is a biometrics reader and seeing the notifications on your phone without being really able to do anything about it from your watch you ll do alright with this watch What it does it does pretty well There are a few nitpicks I have about the refresh rate on heart rate 02 levels and sleeping recording but again 50 smart watch You can t expect it to track every moment of your heart rate or O2 levels My only big complaint is no voice to text to reply to messages quickly on your wrist or even default generic canned responses Everything has to be done from your phone ,positive
