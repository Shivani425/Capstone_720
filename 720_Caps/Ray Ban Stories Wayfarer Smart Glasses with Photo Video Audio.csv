Great product,5.0,Battery lasts longer than a lot of reviews say Get around 3 hrs with 75 volume listening non stop Fit great and feel very comfortable Sound and picture quality ain t the greatest but they are coming from a pair of glasses so can t compare to headphones or speakers Highly recommend ,positive
"Design is there, functionality lacks",3.0,I really wanted to love these as I m a big Ray Ban fan and loved the idea of being able to film hands free and upload to my FB or IG stories I went with the blue light lenses as I spend most my day in front of a computer screen and felt these could be an all day wear Love the look and the subtle placement of the camera lens There are 2 major issues however that may have me returning these First off they record in a square format and the quality is just outdated for today s times You can go into the app and edit the videos into Portrait or Landscape but who wants to do that every time? Also I ve noticed only the right lens records so when you re filming you re going to want to look to the left and down to center the shot All my videos were off centered and cut off a lot of what I was looking at Why weren t the lenses angled down and to the left more to compensate for this? I m not an engineer but that would have been smart Stabilization is an issue too Obviously you re going to be recording with these when you re walking or looking around and I found the playback in these instances to be a little jumpy Secondly the battery is just down right disappointing I get these are a smaller foot print and there s probably not a lot of space to put a bigger battery inside of them but you honestly only get a little over an hour and a half if you re actively shooting videos I went out on a hike and used them for audio only and they lasted about 3 hours Combine that with shooting an occasional video and you ll get around 2 hours max Yikes Having to constantly recharge these just isn t convenient and the case is too big to carry in pocket so if you re on the go which you likely will be if you re wanting to film with these you re out of luck Even if you re at home say working wanting to just listen to music you ll have to recharge every couple of hours That s a major pain point If I could at least make it through my work day on a charge I d probably keep these as they re comfortable and surprisingly offer a good audio listening experience Note the overall sound and bass quality isn t the greatest it s a little flat but it s about what you d expect from glasses and probably better than most others on the market That s honesty my favorite feature on these I can see them being perfect for phone calls and podcasts In conclusion these have the potential to be an amazing thing as technology improves and I hope Ray Ban and Facebook continue this partnership and a 2nd version is eventually produced Actively shooting in portrait mode and in higher quality to match today s phone cameras is a must As of now adding these videos to my stories along with my phone s videos the quality difference is apparent and at this price point keeping them just doesn t make sense for me personally Knocking off a star for the overall camera quality and a star for the battery life ,positive
Best secret agent gear,4.0,As a top secret agent I m always on the lookout for the latest and greatest gadgets to give me an edge in the field That s why when I stumbled upon the Ray Ban Stories glasses with a built in video camera I knew I had to give them a try And let me tell you these bad boys have completely changed the game The video quality is top notch and the fact that the camera is discreetly hidden in the frame means I can capture all the top secret footage I want without drawing any unwanted attention or making me look like a creepy spy The glasses themselves are stylish and comfortable so I can wear them on any mission without feeling like I m sacrificing fashion for function Plus the fact that they re from Ray Ban means they re built to last so I don t have to worry about them breaking mid mission which would be a major bummer All in all the Ray Ban Stories glasses have quickly become a go to piece of equipment in my secret agent arsenal So if you re in the market for a high tech stealthy way to capture video or just want to look like a super cool spy these glasses are definitely worth checking out ,positive
Ray-Ban stories glasses,5.0,I love the Ray Ban glasses they were exactly what I expected them to be They are very intuitive extremely easy to set up and operate I would suggest if you are looking at any smart glasses definitely take a look at these first ,positive

Great But Flawed Glasses/Charge Case Issue,3.0,First off these glasses are nice looking to have a video photo camera not to bulky and for sure I got 3 hours of battery life consistant usually of audio with the glasses However after 2 and a half months of use the battery case to charge the glasses is not holding a charge at all anymore I tried to see if it was just the charger cable or charging outlet in general but so far nothing It kinda sucks that I can t buy another case to charge them ,positive
Great choice,5.0,I like the glasses the v deo quality is great The sound of the speakers I high quality as well ,positive
