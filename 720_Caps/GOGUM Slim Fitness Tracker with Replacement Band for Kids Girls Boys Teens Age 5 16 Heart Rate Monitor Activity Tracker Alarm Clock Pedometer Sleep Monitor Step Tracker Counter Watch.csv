Basic step count semi-smart watch,4.0,I love this watch When my band broke on my list one I went back for the same generic and it is a nice upgrade It s bright and colorful Still can t read it or I m the full sun My biggest company though is that it doesn t show the date and you can t customize the screen ,positive
Works better than my name brand,5.0,I purchased this for my 10yo granddaughter as a birthday gift and she loves it It is very accurate and all of the features work great actually better than my 100 name brand ,positive
My Grandson won’t take it off ❤️,5.0,Grandson loves this watch Won t take it off It doesn t require a mobile phone ,neutral
Look For Something Better,2.0,I don t even know where to start with this there are so many things wrong with this Likely the worst thing is the app It barely works I couldn t get it installed on my daughters Android device Google Play says it s not compatible with her app I downloaded it from another location and installed it outside Google Play Store Setup was crappy Creating an account was like logging in no password confirmation When it got to the point to connect the device pushing the button to find via bluetooth crashed the app likely the reason why it says not compatible on Google Play but it s Android OS I finally decided to install on my iPad to get it working which did work Just as a note one person reviewed this app as racist for asking skin color What a load of garbage Everything seems to be racist these days It s a known issue that Fitness trackers have issues taking accurate readings or measurements on darker skin Do a quick Google search on it It s an imperfection with the technology and is not deliberate or intentional Some low end or budget devices try to accommodate these imperfections in the light sensors by asking skin color in setup Higher end components used in trackers like FitBit or Garmin that makes it less relevant It s not a racist app it s just a not well developed app In addition to the app being pretty bad you can t even use the device without the app Why on a budget device designed for children can I not just set the time date and clear data right there on the watch? I d like to just use the app if I wanted to keep track of historical data Poor design The app developers need to higher a fluent English speaker too because the English is pretty poor Screen isn t as bright clear and vibrant as the screenshots on the listing It s not really horrible for a budget device but it s a bit misleading nevertheless The watch is pretty thick for a younger pre teen girl And pulling the band off to charge it is difficult even for me I can t imagine the band or the USB plug on the watch will last long doing this over and over again With the watch being so thick I assume they could have stuck a mini USB port in the side Poor design The whole watch screen is not touch screen Something I never realized when researching the device Just a small area below the display So to actually enter the sports or fitness mode you have to touch that part of screen for 4 seconds That s where things get complicated Starting one of the sports modes isn t a problem but try figuring out how to stop it in the clunky UI Of course you have to figure out which icon is used to leave the mode versus stop it then hold down for 4 seconds on that icon The 4 second holding thing is annoying It makes getting around the UI a chore and very time consuming Why not a quick double tap? Poor design I d just have to say it was lazy design and development to make a quick buck Either spend some more money to get something better or just go get one of those cheaper devices that doesn t require an app to collect all the same metrics this one does minus the sports and sleeping modes Just avoid this device ,negative
Great for teens,5.0,Since being at home I wanted to get my teenager a smart watch that would be a great way to start off with to help them exercise more and this is perfect Not only are they able to switch out bands but it does everything I wanted it to without it being too overpriced Not to mention if they get this wet I m not panicking because it is waterproof While my teen has worn it washing their hands and showering they ve also left it on while watering plants and even spraying themselves with water The tracker still works Setting this up was really easy to do as I made sure that all settings were correct This not only tracks how many steps they ve done but will monitor heart rate their sleeping patterns and even note every time they workout I was able to download the app onto my phone too so I can see how they re progressing and to check up on their stats There are so many different reminders on here that it reminds them to drink water walk around if they ve been sitting too long an alarm clock and other reminders like homework time etc This is a great starter watch for any kid asking for one and the bands are big enough that they fit my wrist ,positive
Meh...,3.0,Bought since it was advertised for kids I bought two one for each of my kids You do need an initial pairing with app for it to set the time Could not get both watches set up one one phone so had to use another phone to set up the 2nd Kids love it They are able to disassemble to charge themselves ,positive
Not good for multiple kids/devices,3.0,I m writing this review because we just opened ours for Xmas It seems as though you can only have one account per watch which is an inconvenience I thought I would be able to pair more than one watch to the app under my account to track my kids but you can t I didn t rate anything else because we haven t used them yet ,positive
Inaccurate device,2.0,I bought this as a first tracking device for my 10 year old daughter I thought it would be a passing fad however my daughter loves wearing a step tracking device and setting goals for herself I am ready to upgrade as it s not very accurate The step count is off and the sleep timer starts every day after 12 and I can t change it I gave it 2 stars because I really like the band selection and easy charging feature ,positive
