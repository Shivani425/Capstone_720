Good value for price,5.0,I purchased 2 of these fitness monitors for myself and my wife based on reviews and price point We needed something to monitor heart rate during our daily workout routine So far I am pleased with the performance and features of the device The app is easy to use it is easy to connect and the battery life is impressive I doubt the readings for blood pressure heart rate and oxygen level are medical grade but for the price it does what I need it to do With that said it seems the only way to receive warranty coverage and the free extra watch bands promised is to leave a solicited 5 star review as per the email reply from the manufacturer That probably explains the super high ratings I debated on whether I even wanted to participate in this obvious bribery scheme and then settled on leaving a 5 star review for now as I genuinely have no complaints about the product so far but I would be transparent about all aspects of my engagement with the product and company If needed I will adjust my review as necessary based on the actual quality and performance of the product ,positive
Very happy with this,5.0,A while back we decided that we ought to get smart watches fitness trackers in an effort to keep better track of our health and activities We did a large amount of research and picked out one for the male in the family It works well and seemed fairly accurate but was fairly large The female of the family decided it was too large for her and after lots of searching found one that was of a nice size for her tastes After living with if for a while though she decided it was fairly hard to see the face had a short battery life was a pain to charge and the smart phone app was clunky We finally discovered this one and she s very happy with it The larger size is much easier to see but still looks feminine Battery life is much longer and the app is easy to understand and use We re happy with the decision to get this model and are confident it ll provide years of service While it s known that these types of devices usually don t and can t be expected to provide medical grade accuracy this seems to be fairly accurate and very consistent ,positive
Great fitness tracker for a modest price,5.0,The last tracker I owned was a Fitbit 4 that the case came apart on I wanted to find a tracker that was not a Fitbit but was also well made The Mindrose H80 seems to be what I was looking for The style of the fitness tracker is nice and the metal case gives it the feel and look of a nice watch The display is in color and the numbers and letters are the right size for viewing It comes with several nice clock faces and one lets you customize the background with your own pictures This tracker measures steps oxygen levels heart rate and several other parameters There is a lot more this tracker does but the information is on Amazon Bottom line is I am very impressed to get a device of this quality at such a low price ,positive
Easy to read heart rate.,5.0,For a non tech guy like myself it wasn t hard to figure out with the instructions I love how it comes on when I turn my arm to look at it and the touch screen to slide over to the heart rate scale This will be great for brisk walks keeping my heart rate at just under 200 in that fat burning zone Anything above 200 and my liver produces glycogen for fuel Being able to monitor the heart rate and keeping it under 200 is great to get rode of toxic fat and all those disease causing chemical preservatives that have been stored in my fat for years Down to 180 this morning and with this device I should be able to bring that down to 174 soon Hopefully at that weight with some training I can run a 5K before my 67th birthday this July ,positive
So far...I love it!,5.0,I just opened my new smart watch this morning It was super easy to set up and I love the options of the face look and other features I didn t respond on the length of charge since I haven t had it long enough to know I also am impressed with the customer service for my 2 year warranty which I think is a great deal for something that I wear all the time every day I did have one little issue at first with the charger One of the little pins was pushed in and wouldn t make contact But the tiny tip of a pin let it pop back out and it works great I would recommend this watch to others looking for a way to track fitness and time ,positive
