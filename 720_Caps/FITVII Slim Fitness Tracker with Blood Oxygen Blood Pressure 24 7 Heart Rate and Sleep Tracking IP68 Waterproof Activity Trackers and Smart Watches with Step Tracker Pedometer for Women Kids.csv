"This is exactly what I wanted, but . . .",4.0,I received the first watch and couldn t figure out how to charge it It s not intuitive I found a video on You Tube that shows it should come with a cradle to set the watch in for charging I began an exchange of the item and received the second watch the next day Same issue Then my husband found that the charging cable attaches magnetically to the back of the phone I fell like an idiot but in my defense there was no mention of how to charge at the seller s website not a word on charging in the instructions and when I tried to contact the seller via chat the chat never started I want to suggest the seller include info on how to charge in or on the box Otherwise seems like a pretty good deal ,positive
This product is inaccurate but customer service was great to fix problem.,4.0,I really wanted to like this fitness tracker It s attractive and I received wonderful customer service from Allisa I even received a free replacement because of the inaccuracy of the distance feature of the tracker The replacement fitness tracker had the same problem It seemed to be accurate in its step counter and heartbeat and time The app worked reasonably well But the accumulation of mileage was grossly excessive in both trackers 5437 steps absolutely don t equal 37 93 miles I read many reviews and never saw that problem mentioned So it works fine as a watch checking on heartbeat and step counter But after that it is not a good product I gave this 4 stars only because of such great customer service ,positive
did have an issue but fast customer service,4.0,I received my fit watch and used it for a month Really liked the features and wearing a watch again vs having to check my phone for the time After a month though my watch stopped charging I sent an email to the customer service and they were very responsive We triaged a couple things and in the end they sent me a new charger for my watch at no charge ,positive
Consistency and accuracy,5.0,I purchased my tracker primarily for the blood pressure feature and have been very surprised by the accuracy and consistency of the results I have been able to relax more knowing I m being monitored constantly and able to keep the records within the app on my phone Also the exercise and sleep records have been a valuable tool to track as well I cannot say enough how pleased I have been with this watch Enough that I purchased one for my husband as well I keep finding more and more features that I haven t used yet and I ve had mine for almost a year I am not very techy and the support has been fantastic also Highly recommend ,positive
Works well,4.0,I wanted a way to keep track of my steps without always carrying my phone around This works well It also has other features that are nice Keeps track of my sleep can check my heart rate and BP and works as a watch It s water proof so I can take it in the pool and other water but not diving I don t think all the readings and even the pedometer are spot on accurate ,positive
"Great Exercise Watch, So-so Sleep Monitor",4.0,Nice alternative to the much more expensive iWatch Loaded with similar features that are on the iWatch this watch is easy to read as well as navigate and seemed to be fairly accurate compared to my old FitBit The one feature I was really looking forward to using was the Sleep Monitor Being in the habit of going to bed around 7 p m and getting up at 3:00 a m from years of indentured servitude the watch shows me falling asleep around 22:00 10 p m and waking up at 3:30 a m There is no way to switch from military time or adjust to actual bedtime I m sure I am not laying in bed for 3 hours waiting for sleep Other times the watch shows me getting up at 4 a m then going back to sleep at 5 a m until 6 a m Fixing the sleep monitor feature would make this watch outstanding At this point it is just so so ,positive
"Nice watch, great customer support.",4.0,One of the pins was too long for attaching the band to the watch Allisa at Customer Support promptly took care of this issue and send me a new band The only reason that I did not give the watch 5 stars is because the sports modes do not match my workouts ,positive
check BP with a professional device frequently to compare results,4.0,When I first got this I checked my blood pressure with my BP cuff at home and the results were close to being the same After about a month there was quite a lot of difference in the readings Spoke with the company and they suggested some things to get it right So far so good ,positive
