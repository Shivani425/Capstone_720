A sweet spot of budget smart watch,4.0,Has Apple Health integration Touch screen is fairly and responsive Sometimes raising arm does not awake the screen Resolution is fair With metal frame and it feels heavy and decent They are honest and upfront by including tips: step count is every 20 step and data point HR etc sync could take up to 30 seconds IP68 waterproof means this is daily use only not for swimming and diving Look for 5ATM for a waterproof upgrade ,positive

Great value forthe money.,4.0,I wasn t looking for a genius smartwatch I don t need to make calls from it or play games I needed something that could track fitness have a timer a clock date track sleep heart rate SPO2 and blood pressure This also adds and tracks body temp I do wish the app would stop asking me for location every time I sync it but whatever Battery life has been a solid 7 9 days depending on how much fitness tracking I do ,positive
Comfortable,4.0,It meets the characteristics it is comfortable and functional Rated 4 stars because the battery doesn t last long ,positive
great for fitness (not so much medical),4.0,I use pulse oximeters and wrist oximeter to track my o2 and PRBPM levels to help manage my autonomic instability when my wrist oximeter broke I tried out different options including this one this watch is not trying to be for medical use and even says so fair enough but I think if you re just trying to casually track things during and after fitness this would be fine My real issue with it is that it didn t seem to continually track things or perhaps I was using it wrong? it s only short term That said the interface is easy to use once you get the hang of it and if I only needed this for casual occasional use this would be a great fit,positive
Incredibly Impressed with the battery life!,5.0,I was looking to an alternative to the apple watch I didn t want to spend 250 350 on a watch or whatever they go for now I just know it is significantly more than this watch the con to this watch is that the apple iMessages DO NOT send notifications but it isn t a deal breaker for me I wanted it because I like having the digital face watch It counts my steps any exercise activity and it DOES receive other phone notifications on it I received it with 36 battery life in in 36 hours I still have 9 left so the battery life is amazing You can change the face design just like the iWatch It is also super easy to set up you have to download the app that goes with it but the whole process took me minutes to do I like the charger as well that it snaps into and you just plug it into the USB port I also want to mention it charges very quickly so if you want to wear it over night to track your sleeping it will most likely charge fully when you re in the shower etc I haven t worn it over night yet but I will be I am curious what data it collects from there The watch is super affordable functional and a great value I highly recommend this purchase ,positive
GTS smart watch,4.0,Nice watch for the values heart rate blood oxygen and sleep tracking appears to be vary accurate when compared to other measuring devicesEasy to set up using your smart phone Blood pressure measures low battery lasts as long as you aren t using too many automatic applications ie wrist movement activation text messagingWould I buy it again YES,positive
Watch,4.0,I like that I can set the display look and all I can do with it But I don t like that it is way off on BP and stuff I ve had other watches like this and they have been a lot closer on BP than this one ,negative
