Great value! - Waited a bit before posting a review - Use electrode gel,5.0,I don t get why but you can sync use this strap with a TON of different apps I ve got it to sync up with Wahoo Strava Endomondo IpBike and Polar Beat I use Polar Beat because it syncs to Google Fit directly I can t wrap my head around the fact that this thing is so inexpensive and I get to use these apps APP COMPATIBILITY: As mentioned above it can sync with a ton of stuff I like the Google Fit interface and so just sticking with that for now I use Polar Beat to get it over I think Wahoo has some better analytics tho I would like an app that would just let it constantly measure my HR w o having to tell it to do some activity Right now I use Other Indoor and let it run 24 7 because I m curious to know my HR patterns STRAP: The strap looks pretty durable After being unsatisfied with more expensive Polar models usually with complaints pictures showing how the strap breaks this Dash strap looks pretty sturdy with a plastic hook clip thingie I ve attached a picture so you can see it better HRM: It snaps on very strongly I don t think it ll wear over time I haven t verified it s accuracy vs manual measurement but I have pitted it against my wrist activity tracker moved up higher on forearm for more accurate measurement and it matched perfectly so I guess it s pretty accurate BATTERY LONGEVITY: The battery that came with the unit appeared to have died around the 84 hr mark However I think that was because I wasn t getting good contact with the electrodes and thought it was dead The new CR2032 batteries picked up @ Walgreens have currently lasted me about 164 continuous hours almost 7 days I ve even slept with it on RELIABILITY: You gotta use electrode gel I bought some for 10 bucks and should last me years I use a couple drops on each and smear it around I ve used the Dash HRM for almost 2 weeks with about 10 4 days of constant wear 248 hrs I ve used the electrode gel for about 2 3rds of that time The electrode rubbery things on the strap haven t shown any signs of degrading SUMMARY: Really amazing value Cost is great and works with popular apps Strap seems like a better design for durability vs others I ve looked at Gotta use electrode gel if using when NOT sweating a good amount but recommended generally even if you are Battery life is great so I presume it operates very efficiently CON sort of : The battery is a real pain to open Try to use a thick coin like a quarter I used a thicker coin from Chuck E Cheese which worked Putting the battery cover back on is also difficult You need to line it up perfectly or risk snapping off plastic parts used to lock it in place I had to use a lot of downward pressure twisting it back w o damaging the slot for twisting turning Also it took me a couple tries before it started working with the new battery I m fine with this though it s not big deal You rarely will change it out It s really minor and probably just means it s very sturdy ,positive
"Comfortable, works with Polar Beat,  seems accurate and won't break the bank",5.0,Love this heart rate monitor it is so comfortable I have forgotten to take it off after running when I got side tracked It seems accurate should be better than the optical types and works perfectly with Polar Beat It also connects quickly to my phone via Bluetooth while I am listening to my BT earbuds It seems like it will hold up and nothing gives me any concern with it after months of use 3 5 times per week I use a dab of electrode jell on the pads and rinse the whole thing in the shower and it has stayed pretty much like new Considering the price I would not hesitate to buy this again if I lost it I have a Polar Unite as well which gets less use every day I love the Polar Flow ap though which I believe only works with Polar devices since I have a Unite I was able to use it Even though I could take or leave the Unite the upside is that now the Dash data from Beat is also imported into flow Without a the Unite however I was only able to see the Dash data through Polar Beat which was sufficient just not as cool I recall trying this with a couple other aps and it worked fine I just preferred to use it with Polar Beat ,positive
Works Great with Zwift and Strava,5.0,I bought it to be used with the Zwift app for cycling and Strava for recording the cardio output during hiking and walking with iOS and Windows laptop It does work well and accurate To get it going you do have to wet the electrode contact surfaces on the belt Plain water will do for me so try that before you purchase additional paste and such It can take a few seconds before it senses the signal and start transmitting after wetting If you have multiple devices that will connect to it be aware that if it is connected to one device it will not connect to another I go between iPad for Zwift and iPhone for walking with Strava That s how Bluetooth works Be sure to temporariy disable the Bluethooth on other device if you are trying to swtich ,positive
"Accurate Heart Monitor, Excellent Technical Support,",5.0,It was 93 when technology started getting ahead of what I could comprehend And the gap has continued to widen So it was no real surprise that I could not get my Dash heart monitor to connect to my iPhone On their Amazon page Dash said they would help so I called them A nice man named Josh answered and walked me through making the connection Technology can be difficult for me even with help And Josh was patient and polite through the process allowing me all the time I needed to absorb his direction he even helped me download the Wahoo fitness app I used it because Dash had written somewhere that it is pretty simple to use The Dash heart monitor is very accurate I have compared its readings with two high end blood pressure readers that include heart rate I ride a bike 1 400 miles since late April and the monitor has let me see just how effective are my two different ride routines Basically ten miles over rolling terrain or high intensity interval exercises forty versus twenty minutes Turns out that in both types my heart rate exceeds the high performance zone for my age at over 150 bpm That s enough said it s a good monitor that is supported by good people Thank you Josh ,positive
Essentially the same as a Polar H10 but for half the price,4.0,I purchased this since my polar H10 was malfunctioning and eventually was stolen The Polar H10 worked really well and was very accurate for about 15 months Then it had difficulty connecting with my Apple Watch I tried the solutions posted by people on line and at Polar These were temporary fixes The dash is essentially the same product The strap is comfortable and very adjustable I cannot imagine anyone having as issue with it The heart rate monitor so far immediately connects with my Apple Watch and the accuracy is very good much better than the optical heart rate sensor which is used by the Apple Watch itself Given the price the Dash seems like a much better deal since it is about 1 2 the price of the Polar H10 Time will only tell whether it will last ,positive
