A nice step up for the Charge series,4.0,UPDATE May 2022: I m still a big fan of this product and have made a few updates to my initial review s but the bottom line is that it s held up to initial impressions I ended up knocking off a star just because there are a few improvements that can be made but it s still very solid ==============================I purchased the Fitbit Charge 5 as an upgrade from my Charge 3 I skipped the Charge 4 since I didn t really need want the new features of that model but the allure of a color display with the same lengthy weeklong battery life was enough to make me upgrade to the Charge 5 I won t cover all the features of the Charge 5 since there are plenty of other places that go into great detail and I may update this review after I get more use out of it WHO SHOULD BUY A FITBIT CHARGE?The Fitbit Charge is great if your primary use is as a lightweight fitness tracker I prefer the Fitbit Charge over the Apple Watch and other smartwatches due to its lightweight nature weeklong battery life and my lack of need for fancier smartwatch functionality If you like the extra bells whistles of a smartwatch and don t mind a heavier watch that needs to be charged every day or three then you may want to skip the Fitbit Charge Also if you re a die hard Apple user who needs integration with the Apple Health app then you ll also need to look elsewhere because there s no data flowing between the apps in either direction; thankfully the Fitbit app is quite good and does integrate with a number of other apps IS IT WORTH UPGRADING FROM THE CHARGE 3 4?It mainly depends on how much you value a better color display The MSRP on a Charge 5 is 180 though I m sure the sale price will drop during the holiday season while the MSRP on a Charge 4 is 150; though at this point everyone s selling the Charge 4 and 3 well below MSRP especially if you buy refurbished IMPRESSIONS: Initial setup was fairly smooth I had to connect it to the charger to get it started up Transitioning from my Charge 3 to the Charge 5 in the app was easy enough There was a firmware update notice the firmware enables the EDA sensor and that update was a little buggy required a few attempts before it succeeded at one point I needed to reboot my Fitbit ECG monitor became available via firmware update 11 9 2021 I had some connection issues while trying to run it but got it to work eventually I don t have any arrhythmia issues so while it s a nifty feature it s ultimately useless for me The Daily Readiness Score also became available 11 9 2021 It s only available for Premium subscribers It takes 4 days before it starts functioning a couple weeks to tune Overall I d say this is not terribly useful If you work out on a consistent basis get a decent amount of sleep then it s always a great day to work out That is you ll remain in the Good to Excellent range 30 above For reference I typically work out 4 5 days week spending 30 40 min on cardio 30 40 min on weights which ends up being 110 160 Zone Minutes on those days when combined with whatever other Zone Minutes I rack up when not working out But if you take a week off or so return to working out then you may dip below 30 into the Low score range where it says you should prioritize recovery I also noticed that if you forget to wear your Fitbit to bed it can throw off your score; it sent my score plummeting for no good reason otherwise Also perhaps not surprisingly the Readiness Score seems to be primarily reflective of your cardio workout It will classify my Activity as Light on some days when I spend a fair amount of time on weight training that doesn t really sustain an elevated heart rate and less on cardio There s no longer a home button on the side of the display to Return or access additional menus This took a little time to adjust to but I m generally okay with it especially since the touchscreen is noticeably more responsive than the Charge 3 Now you must swipe right to return to the prior screen and you can also double tap in most cases to return to the home screen; though the double tap can be finicky Would I prefer to have a home button again? Yes Now the sides of the device used for the EDA sensor ECG monitor The display is much much better than the Charge 3 4 Brighter with much higher resolution and of course color The display has 3 brightness settings; however the difference between dim normal and max is rather subtle; they re all pretty bright and this is unfortunate because it s a little too bright for dark rooms in my opinion I liked the dim auto and normal settings on my Charge 3 much better Hopefully this is something that will be fixed in a future firmware update assuming the Charge 5 still has the sensor that allows for an auto setting The up to 7 days battery life is not a lie The battery life lasts me about a week with my brightness set to normal which is the same as my old Charge 3 I do not use the built in GPS nor the always on display both of which are a significant drains on the battery but I do average 6 8 hours week of active exercise time And since the dim brightness setting is bright enough for me I use it all the time which translates to even better battery life Pretty amazing considering the brighter color display The Charge 5 does a better job of automatically turning the display on at the turn of the wrist My Charge 3 wouldn t always turn on or would require me to turn my wrist more than what felt natural The Apple Watch is still superior with regard to automatically turning on when looking since there is a slight delay with the Charge 5 after turning your wrist and it still doesn t always turn on The wrist band that s included is a nicer feeling silicone material instead of the plastic one that came with the Charge 3 4 The small strap on the Charge 5 band is also smaller than the small on the Charge 3 4 On the Charge 5 I use the last or next to last notch on the band i e the strap is basically at its largest most expanded size but with the Charge 3 strap I still had 3 or 4 empty notches to work with Not a big deal since they include small large bands but something to consider if you purchase additional bands I did end up purchasing the Sport band which does have more notches to work with Be sure to use Fitbit s sizing tool on their website before purchasing extra wrist bands since they do vary based on which one you get The heart rate monitoring is nice accurate like the Charge 3 I run on a treadmill with a Tickr X 1st gen chest strap and after the first few minutes of running when my heart rate is more stable the readings between the Charge 5 Tickr X are either the same or only off by a bpm or two It s less accurate when doing sprints HIIT since it tends to lag behind the Tickr X but it s still in the ballpark albeit delayed The EDA sensor seems like a waste for me Along the lines of the guided breathing exercises in the Charge 3 it s just something that I don t care to use and I question its accuracy validity anyway I m not sure if this was introduced with the Charge 4 but there s a daily Stress Management Score now The number seems fairly meaningless since it s somewhat of a mystery as to how it s calculated Yes Fitbit tells you what the general parameters are heart rate sleep activity premium members get to see how the sub scores feed into the overall score see below but in the end it just seems pretty meaningless to me I think this may have changed with the Charge 4 but it no longer tracks the number of floors you ve climbed no big deal as it was wildly inaccurate and it counts Active Zone Minutes instead of Active Minutes now Fitbit s website has more details on Active Minutes vs Active Zone minutes There s 23 clock faces to choose from Most of them only display one stat e g HR steps etc at a time though you can usually cycle through them all by tapping the screen which is unfortunate Hopefully they ll add more data rich clock faces but overall it s nice to see them making use of the colorful higher resolution display The charging cable functions a lot better since it magnetically clips to the Fitbit like an Apple Watch does to its charger I believe it s the same charging cable as the Fitbit Luxe My Charge 5 somewhat regularly once every day or two has trouble syncing with the app It has gotten better over time usually just requires me to refresh the app by dragging down at the top of the screen of the phone app At worst I ll need to restart the app and once I had to restart my Fitbit device itself Overall not a big deal Just an occasional annoyance FITBIT PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP:I generally dislike paying for subscriptions since the cost of them can add up to something pretty substantial over time The Fitbit Premium Membership isn t exactly cheap at 10 month or 80 year; though you get 6 months for free with the purchase of your Charge 5 If you actually use many all of its features then it may be worthwhile but for me it isn t i e I won t be paying for membership when my free trial runs out in a week or so The Daily Readiness Score Health Metrics Dashboard are the only premium features I routinely looked at but I question their overall usefulness practicality Here s a rundown of what you get for your money: Daily Readiness Score: see comments above in IMPRESSIONS section in short not terribly useful Health Metrics Dashboard see attached pic : graphs data for Breathing Rate Heart Rate Variability HRV Skin Temperature Oxygen Saturation SpO2 Resting Heart Rate RHR The RHR data is already available for non Premium users you can view you most recent SpO2 reading on the device but the rest of the stats appear to only be available to Premium members The graphs are actually kinda crummy; there s two types: 1 one graph allows you to vary the time scale to view 7 30 or 90 days but you have to visually line up the dot with the values on the y axis to determine the actual reading for each dot and 2 another type of graph shows 7 days at a time with individual readings on the graph but you can t change the time frame scale of this graph It would be a lot nicer if they made these graphs larger interactive so you could change the time scale on the fly tap on the data points to see the reading Wellness Report: You can generate a PDF wellness report to be emailed While it provides a summary of HR weight activity sleep trends over the course of 1 3 6 12 months it s lame that you can t just view this directly in the app Stress Management Score details see attached pic : extra details on your score including the sub scores that feed into it: Responsiveness Exertion Balance Sleep Patterns still not sure how meaningful any of this is Sleep Score details see attached pic : there s a different detailed view of your sleep score; you get sub scores for Time Asleep Deep and REM and Restoration but I believe all the graphs are the same for non premium users so I m not sure that this offers much more insight that the non premium view does; I suppose you get to see how much each sub score accounts for the overall score Instructional stuff: There are various workout routines guided meditations food programs sleep programs you can look up do Games Challenges: You can participate in various fitness games challenges which might motivate you to work out more Overall I think the Charge 5 is a nice upgrade from my beloved Charge 3 and for me it was worth paying the extra bucks ,positive
Battery drain and frustrating support/Updated Resolution,5.0,Update after a seemingly endless merry go round with the reps on chat I finally picked up the phone spoke to a rep and within 5 minutes had email with replacement instructions So I am amending my review since finally I reached a person who could help me Not sure if I just lucked out or just calling instead of texting was the secret but replacement is on the way As for the unit itself when it worked I absolutely loved it It did everything I wanted and more and there is a vast assortment of different bands available for it on Amazon The charge five has turned into a bitter disappointment This is my 4th fitbit over the years and I ve always been very happy with these trackers However less than five months in the charge five Battery has started going down to 0 within hours and I ve been in this endless loop of nonsense with fitbit customer support And they just keep giving me the same useless information over and over Looks like I am just out of luck ,negative
"Just the new version of my favorite fitness tracker, with some flaws",4.0,Through the years I owned every version of the Fitbit Charge Tracker and it still remains my choice the best option given features size comfort price and durability usually a Fitbit lasts me until I cannot longer buy replacement bands I have tiny wrists and although I would love to try the smartwatches from Fitbit they are incredibly bulky and uncomfortable Truth be told even the Charge is a little too big on me but it s the smallest Fitbit product with Heart Rate monitor and sleep tracker What I dislike about the Charge 5 is that they removed stair tracking and that they track `Active Minutes` based on heart rate zones not just being active I do lots of walking and hiking so I might end up with a 5 6 hours hike but no `Active Minutes` because my heart rate was 90 110 during the hike I also dislike the wastefulness of getting both the S L bands there should be an option to only get one I ll never use the L bands even on the tightest loop the tracker would fell off my hand Otherwise the tracker is pretty decent at tracking sleep although 1 2 times a month it won t track a night of sleep at all although I clearly had a good and restful one It picks up runs HIIT workouts and the elliptical fairly easily without me starting the activity It s fairly accurate with step tracker but as most fitness tracker you can easily trick it to add steps by punching the air or moving your hand vigorously The Daily Readiness Score is an useless feature to me I had awful days with a good score and awful days with a fair score; I see zero correlation between that score and my stress level But I didn t purchase it for this feature The skin temperature variation and heart rate monitor are from my perspective spot on It always amazes me how I can use the Fitbit data to know 2 3 days in advance if I get a cold or infection GPS is fairly accurate maybe a few feet off during my runs but usually it shows me on the right streets trails From my perspective the Fitbit Charge is very comfortable I only take it off while I shower and take this time to charge it and it never caused my irritation even on hot sweaty workouts Since I charge it each time I shower I don t think I ever saw the battery under 80 so I can t state how long it lasts on it s own ,positive
