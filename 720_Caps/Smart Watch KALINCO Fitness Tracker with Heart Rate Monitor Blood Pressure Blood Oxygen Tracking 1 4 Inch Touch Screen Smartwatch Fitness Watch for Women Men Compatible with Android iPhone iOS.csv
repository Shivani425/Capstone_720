It's a great smart watch,4.0,I have seen multiple reviews stating the watches tracking and logging of BP heart rate is irregular and they cannot receive text messages Here is my review;As for the BP tracking if you are wearing the watch too loosely on your wrist you might notice that the reading is highly inaccurate try making the watch tighter and see if that helps I took my BP several times with the watch and I must say that it is very accurate I also have a BP cuff that I use to see just how much of a difference between the two Watch 113 70 BP Cuff 116 73 I have done this consistently and it is pretty spot on every single time If I work out or if I leave to go to the doctors office of course my BP is going to fluctuate As long as the numbers are not off by more than 20 digits I think it does exactly what I wanted it to do The same goes for my heart rate both my cuff and the watch differ by about 3 4 digits I can live with that As for the text messages When I buy something that has certain bells and whistles I want all of them to work even if I find them useless Honestly my phone is with me 24 7 but in the unlikely event it is not I will say it is helpful to see what someone is sending me Initially I was not able to see my text messages and it bothered me so I found the user manual online and instantly realized what the problem was I already had notifications enabled on the HeroBandIII app so the next thing was to check the settings on my iPhone My messages were set to display no preview Per the manual if there is no notification display on the phone then the watch has nothing to show Problem solved Since then I am now receiving text messages Now that I know I can I will turn it off to preserve battery life Note: I noticed the messages will only display the last 3 I am fine with that Battery Life Excellent I purchased the watch prior to Christmas charged and received a battery low indicator 12 days later Keep in mind the only notifications I have on the watch are phone and text at the moment I purchased this watch mainly for the design and the features of monitoring my bp heart rate So far so good For the price this watch is doing exactly what I bought it for I have seen the same complaints for some of the watches that cost considerably more It s not always about the cost just read the instructions and you will get more out of it than you were expecting Watch Faces I love the variety I like to change my face often so this is pretty cool Sleep Tracking I have never needed an app to tell me how long I was asleep LOL I lay down and get up and if I feel refreshed I got enough sleep End of story ,positive
"Nice fitness tracker, limited other functions",4.0,I really like the fitness tracking steps heart rate blood pressure blood oxygen level etc I think it does a decent job of measuring sleep The touch screen is nice and the silicone band is really soft and comfortable I was a little disappointed that you can only see messages and not respond to them I wish the size was a little smaller as it s as big as an apple watch but with much less functionaliy It can also start play music but a phone is still needed so I can t use it on its own at the gym It s also not waterproof so I have to be cautious and can t be warn for swim tracking Overall it s a great purchase if you re looking for an affordable smart watch but next time I will be investing in something with more functionality ,positive
Blood Pressure,4.0,My first experience with a smart watch was a Samsung I bought it because it had blood pressure monitor capabilities Once I received it I found out the FDA had not approved the use of this feature on the phone That as well as terrible battery life I sent it back It was well over 200 Fast forward I decided to give this a try Battery life is very good in my opinion maybe 3 days between charges All other features work as described except sleeping and blood pressure The sleep feature shows me sleeping at least 3 4 hours less than I actually do and MOST IMPORTANT: I would not rely on the BP feature if you have stage 1 or 2 high blood pressure When comparing to a cuff I found it to be 20 22 points LOWER and that can be very misleading if your reading 120 and are actually a 142 However figure the difference out and use it as a guide I now add 20;22 points to the reading Others have reported lower than actual bottom line calibrate it with a decent BP monitor and go from there Otherwise I would buy this watch again ,positive
1st SMART WATCH,4.0,I have nothing to compare this to I basically got it because of price Amazon Choice after a fiasco with a health plan watch I got that was useless Not interested in sleep or exercise tracking Wanted heart rate BP due to my age If it s accurate my BP is really good and I m walking more than I thought It was easy to sync to phone which I ve never done with any device Pretty simple to figure out how things worked Like the weather temp part too What I m not happy about is that there are supposed to be lots of faces for the watch or you can add your own pic Most of the faces included are redundant and ugly Very few that aren t just glaring graphics No instructions at all as to how to use your own photos Also can t figure out how to delete the 3 pre loaded faces already on watch and it only lets you add 1 additional for a total of 4 to set use One of the biggest reasons I choose this watch was thinking I d have a variety of pretty pictures to choose from day to day A minor issue is the magnetic charging cable the watch and cable have to sit just so for it to stick very frustrating Would rather have a plug in cable Overall the watch is just a play thing for me but if I get any flack from the Doc for BP or movement I intend to prove stats with watch or find out watch isn t accurate at all UPDATE: I m noticing quite a few questions about weather time not syncing the undata comments pics Be absolutely sure you are clicking selecting and setting the features properly in the App There are 3 different app screens with multiple settings Click the watch stem and scroll through all the screens first if you re having a problem Then if something doesn t show up go back to the phone and make sure you actually SET them in the App Undata only seems to show if watch hasn t had time to wake up sync I haven t had to reset for that to correct itself ALSO if you re considering buying the watch there are 2 band styles the eyelet buckle style and a mesh style that doesn t have a traditional closure can be a little tricky to put on and can come undone if snagged on something I did buy the mesh band and prefer it though it took a few tries to figure it out ,positive
