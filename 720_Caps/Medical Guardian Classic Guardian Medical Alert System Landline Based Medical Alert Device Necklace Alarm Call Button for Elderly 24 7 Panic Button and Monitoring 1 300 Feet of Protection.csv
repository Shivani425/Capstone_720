Does the job,3.0,I bought this health alarm as my husband recently died and I live all alone deep in the woods Especially with this isolation in our country if I fell and hurt myself I might lie there for several days before anyone would find me In the meantime a good friend who also lives alone and I made arrangements to call each other every night at 7:00 That way if one of us did get hurt she would only have to wait one day at the longest before help was summoned Much as I enjoy our nightly chats that is not a forever solution so I got this alarm Yesterday when I called to register this product I balked when they asked for my credit card information or my bank routing number and account number They didn t need this as they send out bills for their monitoring service which is reasonable priced I don t like that information floating around After speaking with my friend and with my credit union and being assured that any unauthorized charges would be promptly removed and the onus would be on the vendor to justify the charge I called back today and completed the registration But I am still a bit uncomfortable with this situation We are told again and again to never give that information out It seems reckless to do so Otherwise we tested both the necklace and the wrist band and they seem to work well The rescue calls were prompt and courteous As I said earlier the monthly fee is reasonable I am comfortable with this product ,positive
"Easy install, easy to use",4.0,First of all there was a message on the box to call this number before you open the box I called the number on the box and was informed it wasn t an active number I had to go on the website to get a number I didn t feel the person I spoke to was very knowlegable She had to put me on hold a couple times to speak to her supervisor To be fair she could have been new She told me I had to connect to a modem which was incorrect Tried to get me to use their lock box for 2 99 a month Buy your own Then asked if I would like the insurance for the unit for 6 99 a month because a replacement box would cost 350 I asked why I couldn t just buy one on line again for the same price I had puchased this one Her answer was that it s company policy I opted not to take the insurance and told her if they didn t allow me to just buy another box for about 1 10 of the price she quoted I would simply go to another company if this box breaks down The item seems to be fine The wrist button fit comfortably I would recommend it to others ,positive
No refund,2.0,I ordered wrong item ,negative
"I live alone, knowing I can have help by pressing a button",5.0,Peace of mind,neutral
Works Great,5.0,I recently received this system and set it up for my mother We had to call in to activate only took about 10 minutes Make sure you have an accessible phone jack They help walk you through it and the rep was very helpful We tested it everything worked as expected gave them our emergency info and that was pretty much it My sister and I feel much better knowing she has this device in case an emergency happens and we re not around Will update here in a few months if need be ,positive
Happy with this device,5.0,Needed a medical alert that could cover my gmom s home this has a 1 300ft range Could not test the full range but it covered her property She likes to garden so we wanted to make sure if she fell outside she could receive help quickly Tested button outside successfully She likes the wrist band too Device is pretty easy to use once set up but you have to call in to activate it otherwise it will not work there is a phone number to call on the plastic wrap ,positive
