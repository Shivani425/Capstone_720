Downloading Da Fit app,5.0,This is my second Yihou fitness tracker The first one was the first fitness tracker I have ever owned I set that tracker up incorrectly apparently I could not get it to adjust to the correct time or date or change from military time I was also confused about which app I needed and how to get it I did not want to download the wrong app and possibly have security issues With help from the community I finally realized I needed to scan the QR code in the booklet that comes with the fitness tracker using the scanner in the wallet app on my iphone I returned my first fitness tracker to Amazon and wrote an unfavorable review of the tracker Yihou Fashion reached out to me and provided more detail on how to set up the tracker and asked if I would try the tracker again since I was still in the market for a tracker First I would like to apologies to Yihou for my edited initial review and thank them for their great customer service Second I would like to explain what you need to do to get the most out of this fitness tracker which is a great value for the money I am assuming the people who wrote the instructions for this device speak another primary language because there is a little something lost in translation I would suggest going to the app store and downloading the required app Da Fit as soon as you order the tracker Alternatively you can wait until the tracker comes in and scan the QR code on the first page of the booklet using your phones scanning app Before you do anything with your phone s blue tooth however go into the Da Fit app you have downloaded and enter your info height weight age etc and allow the access you would like to share with the tracker Where I made the mistake the first time is connecting the tracker using my phone s blue tooth Initially the time and date were right and then they were not If you set it up using your phone s bluetooth settings you will have problems with the date time and probably accuracy of the fitness readings You must synch the device from the Da Fit app not in your phones Bluetooth settings If you do this you should not have the problems others have complained about regarding the time setting especially the 12 versus 24 hour setting Downloading the app and setting the tracker up through the app is really easy When I got the second tracker it took less than seven minutes to set it all up since I already had the app downloaded on my phone I have been wearing the watch for almost a week now I wanted to wait a few days I wrote my first review of this watch after wearing it for a day As I said I ended up returning the first tracker disappointed after about two weeks Then I edited my first review to something unfavorable It was all my fault because I set it up wrong This time it is holding the time and date It is showing regular time versus military time which you can change if you want in the Da Fit app It seems to be tracking my steps properly The heart rate and O2 sensor seems fairly accurate also I used it to click the shutter of my phone s camera and I have received text notices I don t really want other notifications coming to the tracker but you can allow more in the app if you choose to I have used the BP which does not seems accurate compared to other devices I have to measure BP Honestly I think that is an ambitious ask for a device you wear on your wrist that cost 40 and does so many other things Having worked in a hospital I have gotten various BP readings from devices costing much more with one of their primary functions being to measure BP based on different body position or too much movement There are variables involved with BP that could make it difficult for any device like this to capture BP with great accuracy I am not overly interested in this function of the tracker Navigating through the tracker s functions takes a little getting used to Unlike other mobile devices it does not have a touch screen although it looks like it does With the tracker on your wrist you touch the bottom left corner of the tracker to bring up the screen Touch it again to go to the next function screen Touch and hold the bottom corner of the screen to go further into a function Also with the tracker on your wrist just turn your wrist to look at your watch the way you would normally and the time and date screen come on automatically Very cool After a very brief time it goes blank again on its own All in all I am very satisfied with the tracker especially for the price point I think it is a tremendous value for the price It does a few other things if you are interested but all I really wanted was a time piece and step tracker The O2 and heart rate functions are tremendous bonuses They seem quite accurate Furthermore I find the tracker quite attractive and comfortable on my wrist I am not a big fan of jewelry of any sort on my body This is the only fitness tracker I have ever owned so I don t have a lot to compare it to I do not have much disposable income so I thought this was a safe investment for my first fitness tracker I love it and highly recommend it if you re the average person looking to try a fitness tracker

This seems like a good product so far.,4.0,We had trouble setting this up The instructions are a waste of paper so just hope you don t hit any snags setting things up For my wife s android phone there was a problem loading up the app She ran out of space to add it and there was no indication why the phone app was not loading I tried to get some support but there is none that I m aware of We kept trying and once we figured out we had to remove some apps to load the new one it worked fine The QR code doesn t get the app for my wifes phone that s my problem to figure out though Othewise this seems like a good product ,positive
This watch has a lot of features,5.0,This watch does a lot more than I tought it would You just need the app to set the watch up and select the watch face you like When the watch face appears swipe from bottom to top of screen for more features When weather scrern comes up swipe from right to left and weather for week comes up Swipe from left to right and home sceen eventually comes up I don t use all features so I don t know how they work Blood pressure doesn t work Not close to accurate Oxygen level and heart rate seem to be pretty good Step counter gives steps miles and calories Watch has a lot more fratures I really like this watch I ve had it since January ,positive
might not last long.,3.0,I got this instead of a fingertip oximeter because it seemed interesting that it did other things too I got really interested in the sleep tracker and was using it every day We often feel we did or didn t sleep well but having a picture of it confirms or at least makes you more able to know your body habits Go to bed earlier later drink less eat or not before sleeping all these things change how we sleep and having an app to show you the results is helpful But after using it for a few months it stopped being able to connect to my phone The watch face changes on it s own and deleting and downloading the app again turning the device off nothing seems to restore it You can still check bp HR 02 etc but you can t see the record or the detail without the app Disappointed but didn t expect much for 40 especially when others said it didn t last long Some things like letting you see your text messages are useless because they re too small But it s also nice to know your phone is ringing and who is calling I would love this gadget if it were still working Uptate About a year later for the price this is great But there are a couple of things I really don t like about it I would have replaced it by now for these reasons if it weren t a major effort t find one that does what I now know I d like it to SO Every month or so it stops connecting to my phone i e I can t see any data only what shows on the watchface It s annoying to have to reset it a procedure that is not so straightforward But when this happens you also have to delete and reinstall the app which means your accumulated data is gone If it were possible to download it that would help but it would still be annoying I didn t use it for several months because getting it to function again was difficult enough that I have up I also don t like the look of it would prefer something more graceful It s just a big block And the clockface resets itself to somethign I don t like VERY often like every day or two But it s still working and the battery lasts several days before needing to be recharged so I ll probably keep using it for a while still ,positive
