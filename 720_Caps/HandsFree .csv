Good watch but needs a better band for the elderly.,3.0,Battery life is good,positive
No cellular phone service or wifi ability,1.0,A rating of 1 because I returned the watch at the recommendation of the manufacturer They were very nice about that We live in an area of very spotty cellular serve I selected this medical alert watch from other competitors because it claimed to be wifi enabled and I have a wifi personal hot spot in my home However Weelbe support could not get it to connect I am rethinking whether a medical alert watch is a good idea Wearing it in the shower is theoretically a good safety idea but then there is hard to dry wet skin under the watchband The watch needs to be removed to charge it but the watchband is difficult to put back on Not senior friendly My original thought was to charge it at night while I was sleeping but that means that I would not be wearing it if I got up during the night and tripped and fell The overnight charge barely made it through the day I also don t like all of the features pedometer heart rate monitor clock face which possibly would cause an injured person confusion when they just want help The setup process was cumbersome downloading and registering with the Wellbe app on my cellphone registering the watch itself and registering for the monthly service I never got to the point where I could tell a live operator how to inform 911 how to get access to my house Its bulky and I just may consider a pendant We tried ,positive
Not a good purchase,2.0,I am returning this watch today Please think twice before buying It does not work as advertised Problems the battery life is very short 8 hours not 24 hours as advertised It was very difficult to set up And it took 2 days to put in all the medical information they require Also it advertised alerts for medications but it s just a schedule on the phone app There is not an actual alert The phone doesn t function if the battery falls below 20 power The heart rate function is not accurate Overall the only function that works correctly is the watch Also it is almost impossible to get hold of an actual person if you have service questions or to cancel Definitely think twice before spending the money ,negative
Good for security purpose,4.0,The first watch I couldn t activate Contacted HandsFreeHealth com and the provider advised me and ended up sending a new watch and 1 mo free service fee I appreciate the help I still have a problem and notified them about it The pedometer and pulse rate function does not work The important function is a GPS help button which gives me peace of mind ,positive
Thought it was a good idea,3.0,I bought this product for my mother but we can t seem to get it up and going it s linked to her iPhone not sure but there may be a monthly subscription involved we can t get the access code ,negative
Love it,5.0,Had a little trouble with the watch band because of arthritis ,negative
Piece of Mind,5.0, I moved south and my Pop is up north This watch was the perfect solution for both of us I feel better knowing if there is an emergency he can contact help anytime We like that the watch is more discreet then the necklaces style Overall the watch looks great and functions well ,positive
Watch fails to be activated.  Customer service is terrible in rectifying problem.,1.0,Have not been able to activate my new WellBe watch since it has been offline since it s receipt purchasing the subscription necessary to make the watch work Have followed all troubleshooting instructions without success Contacted WellBe for activation help They tell me they will get back to me within 24 hrs This is not acceptable It it truly became necessary to get help it would not be available due to inactivation Only had watch and service for 2days and I am totally dissatisfied with both ,positive
