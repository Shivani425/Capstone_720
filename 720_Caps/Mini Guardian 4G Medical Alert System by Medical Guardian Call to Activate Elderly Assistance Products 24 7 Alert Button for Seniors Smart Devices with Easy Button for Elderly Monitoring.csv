Glad I Got One,5.0,Family had been pushing me to get an alert device and now I m glad I did The Mini Guardian is so much smaller than others I forget I m wearing it It hides easily under clothes when you are more dressed up Although I haven t had to use it I know the fall alert works because I ve dropped it Well worth the extra money ,positive
$50 Monthly Fee,3.0,Called Verizon to see what the fee might be they said this was a device thay they did the service for but that needed to be set up through the product provider Verizon said should be about 10 mo Was shocked to find out that they are asking 50 month Shop around ,negative
Home protection for Senior’s security.,5.0,I use it for emergencies when needed or if no one is around Very helpful Thanks ,positive
Ok I guess,3.0,I called to activate the device got a recording I left my name number Nobody called me back I contacted them via email from their website contact us form No response Today I called again got a service rep I got the device activated did a test response was quick The item did not come with a service agreement enclosed I am waiting for that in the mail I am also waiting to get access to the online customer portal That process doesn t work I don t get a verification code via text so I can t log in At least I know that pressing the button on the device will call for help that s the whole point ,positive
Kind and responsive,5.0,The person I purchased it for has dementia used it to call a taxi service I walked in as the operator was speaking with her and he was so wonderful I should have asked his name but that didn t cross my mind in the moment genuinely could not be more satisfied ,positive
Lanyard Connection is of Poor Construction or Material,3.0,The part that connects the lanyard to the device comes apart very easily In the beginning when it disconnected I was able to slide it back into its joint However now the part of the connection that holds it in place has broken off and I am having to use Gorilla Glue to hold it in place Where the lanyard and the device connects should be made of stronger material maybe aluminum or some water resistant metal or harder plastic but it is not and so it has easily broken This can cause the device to be lost during strenuous physical activities or yardwork and lost damaged or destroyed ,positive
Very reliable,5.0,The Mini Guardian is awesome and the customer technical support was excellent My husband wears it 24 7 and it is small enough that it doesn t bother him at all when he sleeps We test it frequently to make sure we have contact with home base If my husband were to fall it automatically detects it and connects with the company It s waterproof if you take a shower and slip and fall it automatically contacts you with an agent Best purchase ever ,positive
Don't buy here's why!,1.0,We bought this device after my grandfather fell at home and couldn t get up Luckily that time he was able to reach for the phone cord and call my mom But we didn t want to take any chances so we purchased the device in case he fell again We even added the auto fall detection to the subscription in case he fell and couldn t push the button When the device came we set it up and tested it without issue and were assured that the auto fall detection had been added However my grandfather fell twice while wearing the device and it never detected his fall The first time he was okay and was able to get up on his own and call us but the second time he fell face first with the button even underneath of him he hit his head on the way down and was unconscious If I hadn t checked on him before going to bed he probably would have died on the floor The button was never alerted and never sensed anything He s now in the hospital in ICU and will not be able to return home When my mom called to cancel the subscription they tried to persuade her to keeping it even after she explained what happened They weren t empathetic or remorseful at all They even told her that the auto fall detection was never added to the plan and the guys response was oh it was just a mistake When my mom persisted and told them to cancel the subscription he then attempted to charge her a restocking fee even though the device itself was purchased through Amazon I am disgusted and disappointed by this entire experience It was evident that they care more about the money from their subscription which is not very affordable to begin with than the actual subscribers who are trusting them for emergencies ,positive
