Helpful for me.,4.0,I have been using the device for a while now I am using it to help with my sleep apnea Using the app I can see the times and levels of my oxygen intake The app also shows my heart rate and how much move around at night The battery easily covers a good 9 hour night I can also keep the recordings to show my doctor I can not use the CPAP machine I set the device at 80 oxygen Since I started using it at that level I am keeping my breathing in 95 range When it starts to go lower the alarm is enough to make me breathe more to get the level back up to where it should be 95 The alarm can be annoying at times if you are having a lot of drops but you are not keeping you level up so that us what you want it to do I have used it for 90 days I do have bad nights where it drops lower but not that many The read outs help me to see what time my breathing drops and I can see what I was doing at that time Most of my drops are when I am going back to sleep It is usually steady the other times The more I use it the better I am getting at controlling my breathing I hope to up my percent to 85 and start over I do believe that the size of the ring would make my readings better There is some gap and I have to use a glove with a hole in it to keep it on Right now I feel this device is working for me I have done a lot of research and will be taking them to my doctor These are my results and they are working for me ,positive
This Ring Was A Game-Changer For Addressing My Sleep Apnea,5.0,I have moderate sleep apnea While this device is not approved by regulators for apnea it is the only thing I am using to treat it currently and my sleep physician has approved this The results have been amazing I formerly had a BiPAP machine When I first got that machine I used it religiously for about four years The results were so so in terms of how sleepy I felt during the day During my fifth year of BiPAP use I subconsciously began to rebel against the BiPAP machine during my sleep I would wake up with a mask ripped off I just really began to hate that machine with a passion and felt that the mask was like a plastic octopus glued to my face Enter this ring I bought it with some skepticism but some hope that it could help I used it for about two weeks with amazing results I clearly had some major apnea events while I was asleep judging from the included smart phone app The buzz vibration from the ring woke me up during the apnea event That is my low blood oxygen level triggered the vibration and such a low level is a clear signal that I have stopped breathing the hallmark of an apnea event So I called my sleep physician and asked to have an overnight home sleep test after explaining the situation In short I had the sleep test and had a score better than most healthy people without apnea It turns out that in my case my apnea seems to occur when I sleep on my back This ring buzzes when my oxygen level becomes low and I ve learned to shift on my side and sleep on my side This virtually eliminates the apnea My sleep physician agreed that my results were extremely encouraging and told me I could just use the ring instead of the BiPAP We agreed I would do an annual home sleep test to ensure that the ring continued to help me I have been using the ring for approximately three months I honestly believe I am getting better results than when I had the BiPAP machine I feel more rested While I am not a doctor and while my physician is not your physician in my opinion this ring can be a game changer for many of those suffering from sleep apnea For about 160 bucks it s worth a try Make sure your physician okays stopping BiPAP or CPAP however BTW I also use a magnetic sleep ball I bought on Amazon It is a hard foam ball that splits in half and has a magnet in the center I place it on a T shirt in the center of my back This has helped me with my positional training It encourages me to sleep on my side Combined with the ring discussed above and as stated above my results have been favorable indeed ,positive
Great for tracking resting heart rate and O2 levels.,4.0,I need an accurate way to track HR and SP02 during the day and at night This device does a great job at this I love the fact that I can download the reports to both my phone and my computer without worrying which device gets the report first etc It all happens very easily The reports are great and you can add notes to the report to explain what it is you were trying to track Now for the ring: It is comfortable and seems to work well You can have a live display of your readings on your phone which is very convenient if you cannot be looking at your hands I compared the SP02 function against a regular finger pulseOx and seemed to get good readings In fact it seems to be more accurate than my other finger pulse ox device The resting heart rate readings are accurate but elevated readings such as during exercise are not very accurate During exercise I had three devices comparing my heart rate The readings for two of them were 143 and 145 which was about what I expected The O2 ring only gave a reading of 105 The ring works well for resting heart rate but not so well for elevated heart rates The ring has a black plastic screen with numbers that are way too small I hope they increase the display size in future versions There is a setting for normal and always on In regular mode the screen stays on for a few seconds and turns off automatically whenever you tap the button on the face of the ring I wish there was another option for 30 seconds or 1 minute Sometimes I find myself having to tap the button multiple times when I am staring at the screen Not a big deal though The band is a silicone and fits different sized fingers with ease and comfort Overall I think if you need this to track your resting or sleep data it works great If you want it for exercise this may not work for you ,positive
