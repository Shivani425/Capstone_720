Save your money or spend it on something else,3.0,Thought this would work great since I have heard of the Skechers brand But the app was outdated in design and functions and that s probably why it didn t sync properly Sure it looks nice but what s the point if won t work right I returned it and got a Misfit Flash: ,positive
No App in Apple Store,1.0,First it said there it was iOS compatible it is not There s no app available disappeared two months ago and the reviewers stated When she charged it nothing happens no red light no blue light no purple light Nothing waste of time and money ,positive

Donâ€™t buy this,1.0,I was looking for a sleep tracker The reviews I read said it worked well for that and basically nothing else It was cheap so I thought why not?Well apparently the app is not supported any longer This means THAT THE BAND IS USELESS Without the app the band gives you no information except maybe to tell you it s on so you just have a fancy rubber band on your wrist If they want to keep selling it they need the app up again Until then don t bother I returned mine ,negative

No App;,1.0,How can you have a tracker without an app? I can t believe Amazon is allowing this to be sold and putting their stickers on it saying thanks to you this product has a second chance Really?,positive
Go Walk,4.0,I like keeping track of my steps and this gadget works great You have to be careful if the band gets caught on anything it falls off very easily I have almost lost it several times The blue tooth takes a few tries for it to log on but once it does the information is great ,positive
