An Interesting Device,4.0,Wanting to add muscle mass I was intrigued by this device and ordered it After it arrived I discovered how easily it attached to my phone and the instructions in the form of multiple screens make the first time using it an easy task Unfortunately from that point on whenever you use it you have to run through the same series of instructions again yes every time There are also a great number of sets of muscle groups to measure It comes with biceps thigh and solar plexus pre programed I would also like to measure my forearms calves and shoulders but am unable to find out how to program them into the app A way to set up all of the muscle groups I am interested in measuring without scrolling through the instructions or having to choose them individually every time I open the app would be appreciated ,positive
Quick and simple,5.0,The app was easy to install and found the device via Bluetooth instantly I did my first scan pleasantly surprised to see my leg workouts have me above average but not my arms which is expected The entire process felt very polished not janky at all the opposite of every Bluetooth speaker or headphones I ve had My daughter wanted to scan herself too We didn t have any problems putting the scanner on her phone to scan herself and then going back to my phone to scan me Thankfully it s very easy to share with my family The only part that tripped me up was finding the power button The big square obvious button is the trigger to scan there s another small button at the top to turn it on off Knowing that I can scan myself each morning in less than 60 sec,positive
Disappointed,2.0,I was very excited about this thing because of the CES awars but it s simply not ready for prime time The app didn t work at all on Android and on Apple it was very buggy And this thing depends on an app to be able to use it Readings taken within a few minutes were wildly different Hate giving bad reviews but going to have to recommend against this Returning mine ,negative
It beeps every 20 seconds while charging. Why why why?,1.0,[This is a real review from a real human being]Ok aside from the annoying beeping while charging that you can t do anything about it only has a 600mah battery which should take only 15 minutes at most to fully charge from usb c The app isn t helpful to even know how full it is and it s been charging for a half hour and it still won t let me use it Fitto shipped with an almost fully discharged battery I have no idea how good the device itself does what it claims we ll see once this charge is finally done ,positive
Will not charge and or turn off . Returning,1.0,Will not turn on or off by button,neutral
easy to use and cute shape,5.0,At first I worried about the color choice but I really like this cream color And it is easy to use and very useful to connect with App and measure muscles of my body instantly I would like to regard this opportunity as a good motivation for managing my body and I think I will continue to take care of my body with cute Fitto ,positive
