Mixed review...,4.0,Wanted to give this some time to actually fund out how they worked Purchased 2 of the units one for me and one for my wife Followed the prep instructions and all started our well but my wife s won t hold a charge for more than 2 days Mine lasts a week and we have them set identical as to operation We haven t had issues with the app one on an Android phone other on an iPhone Units are providing pretty aquerate information and helps to track things as we are both very active and have demands on our lives Right now the only issue is with battery life on the one unit ,positive
Great Customer Support,4.0,I haven t had the product or used the app long enough to be comfortable with it s full capability But I can say so far I m happy with the product and learning moreeveryday I am not a tech savvy person 5 star rating still to come I will say with out a doubt that customer service support is second to none 2 Emails sent and were responded to by the next business day with resolutions to my issues As of now I would recommend this product and the seller to anyone interested ,positive
Does everything as advertised.,4.0,I bought to track my heart rate and blood pressure This is a no thrills way to keep tabs on everything The only downfall is the charging; you have to pull one of the band arms off Sounds easy but it s a watch and the band arm is pretty snug Doesn t affect function at all ,positive
My first smart watch,4.0,Its a nice watch I did take my BP about 2 min after taken by machine in dr office and top was 30 of what it said But I LOVE the sleep study part Customer service is fantastic Im suppose to get 2 free band colors If I could change one thing it would be how you charge it The band is WAY too hard for me to take off to charge My husband has to argue with it And he does So Im going to check BP again after a different dr office does BP If it changes I will be doing an addendum to this review So far the 1 star is ONLY for the charging ease ,positive
Battery dies quickly,4.0,Good in theory Difficult to take the band off for charging If your phone is on vibrate it kills the battery Mine doesn t even last till I get home from work I could change my phone settings to make it last longer but that doesn t work for me on the job ,positive
"It does a pretty good job on pulse and BP, but questionable on O2.",4.0,Fires to all I dislike the bulk of this instrument and the way it wants to remain on your wrist at bedtime; it also lights up and flashes at night uninvited Aside from that it is a pretty good overall body check machine BP Pulse functions are pleasant and there are surprising other options I haven t touched yet like messages It counts my steps and does other amazing things I would say for the price it is a nice little accessory and BTW it keeps accurate time ,positive
Nice,4.0,Just what I needed for self monitoring in a slim low profile full function smart watch ,positive
If I had know it was so easy to charge I would have gotten it sooner,4.0,Needed a step tracker and did not want to spend a small fortune This came quickly I love how I don t need yet ANOTHER cord to charge it on top of my tablet my personal phone my work phone my earphones it fits right in the USB UI is small but graphics make information clear The set up in the app was a litle challenging as my andrioid did not do what their directions said it should But I believe I have it figured out now ,positive
