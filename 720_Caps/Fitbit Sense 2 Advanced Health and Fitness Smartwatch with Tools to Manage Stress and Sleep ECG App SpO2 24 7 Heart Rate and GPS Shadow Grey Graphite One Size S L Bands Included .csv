Pretty good,4.0,I decided to give a smart watch another chance after starting with an Apple Watch many years ago I was happy with it but I specifically want to use it for exercise and more specifically hockey I found the Apple Watch was a bit too big to keep on while playing I moved to a smaller FitBit and really enjoyed it but eventually I wanted a bit more features and came across the Sense 2 Off the bat there were two things that led me to this particular watch battery life and price I was fearful of getting another watch and not being able to use it for hockey so I wasn t ready to drop a ton of cash on some of the competitors In addition I loved the idea that the watch has several days of battery life So far it s true to the advertising and my battery stays good for 5 7 days depending on use The tracking features work well and it s comfortable on the wrist Overall I would recommend it ,positive
Overall good product!,4.0,I purchased the Sense 2 to replace my Sense Overall I am happy with it It tracks sleep activity heart rate steps climbed stress and you can track food in the app It doesn t have some of the abilities that the sense did such as music storage but it does still have all the features I use and they work well for me The ECG feature works well but there is no shortcut for it making it difficult to find when you want to use it I feel like the price is a bit high as well considering that it doesn t carry all the features of many smart watches in that price range but I stayed with fitbit because I like the fitbit app so well I ve only been using it for a few weeks but so far I am happy with it ,positive
Finally a great smartwatch with all the bells and whistles,5.0,Above all this is a lightweight and comfortable smartwatch I own the Galaxy Active 4 LTE and it is not comfortable I couldn t begin to wear it all day yet alone sleep in it I tried: Pixel smartwatch not comfortable so I assume round doesn t work for me Then I found Fitbit First Luxe which is elegant but way too small to read anything Then Charge 5 which is also nice but I really wanted to be able to answer calls and have Amazon Alexa So I just tried the Sense 2 So impressive First the Fitbit Mobile App is really good Very accurate steps Great sleep tracking Answering calls is a breeze and I can hear speaker Asking Alexa is very simple At night you swipe up and touch sleep mode and it goes nite nite Doesn t turn on unless you tap screen I have size 6 wrist and slim forearms I m a senior female This is a lovely watch and I highly recommend it ,positive
"3 updates: Final Verdict; Not a $300 smartwatch, fails to measure HR accurately during exercise",2.0,Original review: Well This is an early review Can t judge the durability of the sense2 yet Out of the box i turned it on Setup was quite smooth paired with the phone Android received a software update directly The screen has good punchy colors The HR monitoring seems to be accurate on the normal levels compared the reading with a BP device reading I m yet to try it during exercise ECG worked well Some people here mentioned something about it being sluggish I have experienced that when i swipe up to scroll down the notifications However swiping between tiles is smooth and snappy Also the watch did suddenly freeze and rebooted without a reason once As for the GPS seemed that it catched the signal quickly and tried it for a short walk and the track was accurate Alexa functions well and the speaker is just ok As For texting and notifications you ll receive it properly and you can send short replies that are preloaded like: yes no I m busy etc emojis or a voice message that is transcribed into text Overall I m satisfied with the purchase until now but bear in mind this unit I ve got during the deep discount below 90 So honestly this is a good fitness tracker for that price range But in my opinion it definitely isn t worth that MSRP at 299 I d say this goes fairly between 90 120 I don t think I ll pay more for that You can t install third party apps as of yet you can t control music or anything else Watch faces on the app aren t that much interesting You can t change watch faces from the watch you need to use the app for that which is quite inconvenient For battery life I can t comment on that I ll update when I see a definite pattern But it looks like something that will live for about 4 5 days with moderate usage Fitbit pay was easy to setup Google wallet and other google stuff are promised to be added in future updates we ll see Sleep monitoring is yet to be tested But I ve seen on YouTube that this is a good sleep tracker I ll be testing that Update1:The HR monitoring is ridiculously off the charts during exercise Did weight lifting and some HIT and it didn t perform well My Huawei band 6 was far more accurate wore both If you want a fitness tracker for heart rate monitoring look elsewhere Plenty of bands that are actually fraction of the price and do way better in monitoring HR Updated with another exercise session see picture After 40 minutes of heavy exercise weight lifting and running pushups etc The BP device reading 158 while the sense2 could read 77 Mind you during the whole exercise it was below zone while i know very well my heart was beating twice as the sense2 is sensing At rest it monitors quite accurately but whenever you do an exercise you ll definitely notice it doesn t catch even a close reading to your actual Heart Rate Update 2:Received the new update now the device supports on wrist calls but i noticed that there s significant lag between when the phone rings and when the watch receives the call which is quite disappointing Also you can turn off display when you cover it with your palm which is a gimmick for me but ok Google wallet and maps are yet to be added For fairness The new update seems like it managed to fix the accuracy of HR tracking during exercise not sure if it s gonna be sustainable see Fitbit app screenshot As for the battery i believe it will at Max serve you for 3 and half days I haven t used the GPS always on display is off during sleep and motion to turn on the screen was also off whole days I kept other functions on So with moderate usage I think this can barely go on 4 days on full charge Notification texts in Arabic are displayed in some weird shapes and letters that are not Arabic so you can t read any text notification in Arabic maybe this can be fixed in future updates Update 3:Now google wallet and maps are downloadable on the watch go to the apps section on the Fitbit app and you can download them Main complaint is again inaccurate inconsistent HR monitoring during exercise in one session it gets it quite accurate on another occasion it does not I even tried to tighten it further more on my wrist to see if this gonna make a difference but it did not For a 40 minute of HIT and weight lifting it almost kept giving me a HR below 100 while I m sure my HR was at least above 140 It seems like while at rest it catches the HR accurately but at peaks and cardio levels it is way very inconsistent Other functions are as advertised and no complaints Final Verdict after about two months of usage I ll take three stars one for the inconsistent HR monitoring one for the unreasonable MSRP and third for the limited functionalities of the app and the watch It is more of a fitness tracker than a smart watch but since HR monitoring is not consistently accurate this takes a large chunk of this device even being useful as a fitness tracker All in all this is more of a fitness tracker than a smart watch with inconsistent HR monitoring So fair price in my opinion is 100 120 max I honestly would never pay more for that especially the Fitbit premium feature in the app Will require a subscription after 6 months That s all Hope this helps ,positive

Long battery life and decent tracker.,4.0,Bought as fitness tracker Keep getting a message every few minutes to Tap to Pay Lots of people on Fitbit forums with the same problem Also the ECG is very hard to get to read I usually have to attempt the test several times to get a result Also only displays oxygen readings for sleeping hours The watch has good points but it is not all good ,positive
