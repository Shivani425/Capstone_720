Excellent for monitoring Atrial Fibrilation BUT THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT LID NEEDS TO BE REDESIGNED!,4.0,I don t want to write an entire review since Christopher R did such an excellent job of it Please read his review for details There are a few things I would like to clear up; that others have mentioned in questions and reviews 1 I ve had absolutely no trouble getting it to work with an Android device However it uses ultrasonic sound not an electrical signal so you need to make sure there isn t a lot of high frequency noise in the area and that your device s microphone is working well and not blocked or covered This also means you need to get the device relatively close to the Kardia 2 I ve had the EKG this little device takes verified with a full EKG by a cardiologist in a hospital several times so I m confident it s accurate 3 However the reason I didn t give it 5 stars is the BATTERY COMPARTMENT LID This is my third Kardia I keep losing them and I ve always had significant difficulty with the battery compartment cover YOU GUYS NEED TO REDISGN THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT LID This last one was bent slightly and almost impossible to get on It s a wonder I didn t break it putting it on I used the back of a heavy duty steel fork with a roundish handle to press it into place I haven t had one long enough to have to change the battery yet so I can t imagine how hard it will be to replace it ,positive
Be carful with the reports.,4.0,If you have a smartwatch that monitors your EKG it s just as good This device is problematic with the Near field connection You have to turn it off to use this device This means that you must turn it back on when you want to use one of the Smartphone pay apps i e Samsung Pay Apple pay and Google pay Most people will not remember to turn it back on after using this product So you will get stares from customers behind you in line while you figure out what is wrong with your Payment app This device will also have issues with connecting to the app on my phone even though it is right next to it And I changed the battery to make sure that it was not the issue Be sure you don t panic when you have a possible AFIB reading If you have medical insurance then report it to your doctor The in app solution is for you to pay 79 to speak with a cardiologist about the report And as my Doctor noted it would be nice if we could print the information out for you to bring to the office Is it worth the price maybe? Would I recommend it to family or friends maybe? It s useful for what you can get out of it ,positive
Good way to track issues and show doctor,5.0,Works easy and stores results If you have an episode the device if you use it while it is occurring like Afib will record it to show the doctor I would have liked it to include a carrying case but one can purchase them for an additional fee ,positive
Cardio Mobile,5.0,This is a tremendous item for the money Works great right out of the box and very easy to set up and pair with your smartphone I am absolutely totally satisfied with this product and I think you will love it too ,positive
This can be a useful tool to record your heartbeat but....,4.0,This can be a useful tool to record your heartbeat but I m not fond of the fact that a log is created of your heartbeat and you don t know who sees it The value is in the paid upgrade so that a medical professional here in the USA can read the single channel EKG and interpret it for you if you request it up to 4 times per year ,positive
An important tool in keeping track of my health.,5.0,As a man who has had atrial fibrillation in the past I was pleased to learn about this device app I keep close watch on my vitals and this is just so easy to use I couldn t be more pleased with it My practice is to use it at least a couple times a week and if I am feeling odd or out of sorts check my rhythms It is reassuring to get such an EKG readout and be certain I have not re entered AFib One feature I particularly like is the ability to save the plot as a PDF so I can store it for my own records or forward it to me cardiologist if need be I consider this purchase to be one of my best ,positive
Good device - delivers on advertised capability. Additional features available through subscription via app.,4.0,Like a lot of people when I first saw the commercial for this device I questioned how anything at this price point and size could provide accurate results for an EKG something that I ve always had to be hooked up with leads at my doctor s office to get I haven t been to my cardiologist since purchasing the monitor so I can t comment on its accuracy from a medical perspective just yet I will update the review with this information when I have it The remainder of my review will focus on its features and getting things up and running out of the box Initial device setupTake it out of the box and remove the plastic from around the battery on the bottom of the device The physical part of the setup is that simple There are no on or off buttons or buttons of any kind on the device itself it s about as simple as you can get This is definitely a plus for a device like this After all if someone is experiencing an incident and trying to take an EKG the last thing one wants to do is fumble with buttons and switches Kudos on the design App setup and useThe app was fairly easy as well download it from the App Store and create your account in it The app guides you through taking your first EKG as well which leads to the only surprise that I got out of the whole process: after taking your first EKG it must be submitted to Alivecor for a medical review This review must be completed by them well a medical professional through them before you can do anything else with the device The message in their app says it typically takes up to 24 hours to complete this review mine was completed in around 20 hours Until that s complete the device is essentially a paperweight albeit a cool looking one Initial EKGAs mentioned earlier your first EKG must be reviewed by one of Alivecor s medical professionals before you can continue using the device The app states that this is an FDA requirement The device is regulated by the FDA so the statement is logical plus it just makes sense from both a quality control and legal perspective This however is one thing that they do not advertise enough prior to purchase They do state it on their website but it s buried in the Frequently Asked Questions section This wasn t a big deal to me and in fact was a benefit Who wouldn t want a board certified cardiologist to look at an EKG and provide an interpretation for free? However those who expect to get the monitor and jump right in taking recording after recording on the first day will be disappointed that they can t Subsequent EKGsIt s simple to take an EKG and only takes about a minute to complete Sit down with a solid flat surface in front of you Get as comfortable as you can Open the app and place the phone as close as you can to the monitor The instructions say within 12 inches and they provide an attachment plate that will attach the device to your phone I haven t used the attachment plate so I can t comment on it Click on the Record Now button Place the index and middle fingers from both hands on the plates on the device and sit still and relax for 30 seconds Afterward the app will ask whether the EKG was of you or someone else That s it easier and quicker than getting hooked up with all those pads from your doctor s EKG machine An instant analysis will indicate if the EKG was normal abnormal or unclassified Normal is of course what you want to hear There are a number of reasons that the EKG could be unclassified that are listed under the Frequently Asked Questions section of Alivecor s website One of mine came back unclassified when my heart rate was over 90 so I d recommend not using this to take an EKG immediately after exercising I did this as a test to see what the EKG monitor could do The App Premium FeaturesWhile the device is simple and well designed it s useless without its companion app which works well on my iPhone 7 Plus While the app is fairly easy to navigate and includes some good features those who bought the EKG monitor with the expectation of getting more than a simple record and store one result experience without purchasing a subscription will be disappointed When creating your account in the app you re given the option of starting a free 30 day trial of Alivecor s premium service My recommendation is to try it out This adds some features to the app that are handy a place to record resting heart rate medications taken for the day blood pressure from an Omron cuff and a weight diary While all those features and useful and good the main reason to consider a premium subscription is storage of multiple EKG test results Without a premium subscription only the last result is stored This subscription is available for 9 99 monthly or 99 99 annually and payment information must be entered manually through the app This is primarily what prevents my review for this device from being 5 stars In my opinion 10 per month is too expensive for a subscription price unless someone has cardiac issues which require frequent monitoring 4 99 per month or even less for the casual user would provide better value I also think that the EKG journal feature which saves more than just the most recent EKG reading should be part of the basic free plan Lastly the app doesn t accept ApplePay for subscription fees ConclusionThe device is simple to use and so is the app This has great potential and I d recommend that those who wish to do more than monitor their heart rate and blood pressure consider buying this EKG monitor Just be prepared to pay more than the purchase price of the equipment in service fees annually to make the monitor as useful as it can be ,positive
