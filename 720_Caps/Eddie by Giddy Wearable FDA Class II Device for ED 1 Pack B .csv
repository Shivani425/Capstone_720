"This product works as advertised, but must be sized correctly.",3.0,The value is way off this should cost between 50 60 for how flimsy it is The rubber bands break easily Make sure you size it properly or it will slip off once you use lubricant The firmness of the erection was excellent once I sized it properly ,positive
Did not work for us.,4.0,Did not constrict bloodflow adequately We tried size A with sport band Item costs a lot it is not as comfortable as a regular c ring I was actually able to get a refund which I appreciate This company has good customer service ,positive
"Orange works better, less expensive",2.0,Using for ED Oring is less expensive amd works better The device reduces usable length of shaft ,negative
Material larger in diameter than what I was expecting,4.0,I think the size I chose was pretty close being the B size It may be just a little small but I think the next size up would be a little too big The thing that surprised me a little is the diameter of the material This is not the size diameter but the actual diameter of the device It is not completely round but is very close in size to that of a plastic close hanger It is not plastic at all but is more like a fairly hard but very flexible rubber Does not hurt like plastic would I guess I was expecting something about 1 8 inch in diameter when this one is more like 345 inches at the wide front to back as again it is not quite completely round Basically reduces length by the 345 inches when of course we all want the most available Overall I am not complaining at all and would purchase again ,positive
Not worth the money,2.0,A rubber band could do the same thing for a lot less,negative
appropriate size,4.0,Have not used the product to date but may request an exchange from Eddie by Giddy ,neutral
This is easy to use and well made,4.0,Since dealing with my ED this product has helped me gain more confidence to be able to satisfy my spouse ,positive
Not Giddy about it - my take on ED devices,1.0,Not new to the ED device game as I ve been suffering from it for the last couple of years I ve tried most if not all ED device options on the market I haven t had too much time with the Giddy but the times I have used it have been problematic The device sits at the base of the shaft and it was challenging to get on and off and I was fearful of the rubber bands pinching my penis I assume I will be less fearful with more time I ordered the B size and the constriction was not adequate to make that big of a difference in obtaining an erection The sizing tool was very confusing and I feel that if I go smaller it will pinch more and there could be a lot of difficulty with getting it on and getting a proper fit reading other reviews I don t believe I m alone in this assessment The packaging is very slick and is well done It is also way too expensive I mean I paid around 165 and this was even discounted A more sensible option that I have had much better results with doing about the same thing is the Omegaflex Open Ring It comes packaged with 2 sizes Small and Large so I didn t have to try to figure out what size I needed and no rubber bands Designed to provide a great orgasm and is much cheaper I ve had consistent results and for the price point it deserves consideration In the meantime I ll keep trying to find a better fit and comfort level with Eddy before I ask for a refund ,positive
